            <p><strong>Abyssinian cat</strong> is a breed of domestic short-haired cat with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat, in which individual hairs are banded with different colors. They are also known simply as Abys.

            The first members of the breed to be exhibited in England were brought there from Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia), whence the name. Genetic studies place the breed's origins in Southeast Asia and the coasts of the Indian Ocean, however. It is possible that the breed was introduced to Abyssinia by travelers who had stopped in Calcutta.
            
            Once a comparatively obscure breed, the Abyssinian had become one of the top five most popular cat breeds by 2016.
            
            The breed's distinctive appearance, seeming long, lean and finely colored compared to other cats, has been analogized to that of human fashion models. Personality-wise, the cats traditionally display active, curious attitudes in which they frequently follow owners around and encourage play. Their dog-like characteristics also involve a particular sense of affection and desire for interaction. Abys have a distinctive wildcat look with their ticked coat and large erect ears. They are a highly social breed and can be demanding of attention. They do well in multi-cat households due to their social nature. Not a lap cat, Abyssinians are in constant motion, either exploring or playing.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            What is thought to be the earliest known designated Abyssinian cat is in an exhibit still residing in the Leiden Zoological Museum in Holland. It was purchased around 1834-1836 from a supplier of small wild cat exhibits as a taxidermy and was labeled by the museum founder as "Patrie, domestica India." The first example of a domesticated Abyssinian, however, involves the story of a cat being brought to England by the British Lt. General Sir Robert Napier in 1868 who had returned from the Abyssinia War. The cat was given the name "Zula" and won first prize in the December 1871 Crystal Palace cat show.

Many modern Abyssinian breeders dispute Zula as having been the first domestic Abyssinian, arguing that the existing illustrations of Zula portray the cat as having ears too small for an Abyssinian and a coat too waved and long.

The breed was nearly wiped out in the United Kingdom following the Second World War and an outbreak of feline leukaemia virus, resulting in cats being imported from places such as Holland, America, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand.

The Abyssinian is one of the oldest established cat breeds, being recognised in 1929 by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. The breed was developed in the United Kingdom with references dating back to the 1890's.
          </p>
          <h3>Appearance</h3>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465338/1312/Cats/Abyssinian/Valentino_tkccva.jpg" alt="abbysinian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg" >
          <p>
            The Abyssinian is a lithe, fine-boned, muscular, medium to large sized cat. The average weight is 10 lb (4.5 kg) ranging between 8-12 lb (3.6-5.4 kg) with height ranging between 8-10 in (20-25 cm). The head is moderately wedge-shaped, with a slight break at the muzzle, and nose and chin ideally forming a straight vertical line when viewed in profile. They have alert, relatively large pointed ears. The eyes are almond-shaped and are gold, green, hazel or copper depending on coat color. The legs tend to be long in proportion to a graceful body, with small oval paws; the tail is likewise long and tapering.

Abyssinian kittens are born with dark coats that gradually lighten as they mature, usually over several months. The coat is short, and is ideally fine, not soft, dense, close-lying and silky to the touch. The ticked or agouti effect that is the trademark of the breed—genetically a variant of the tabby pattern—should be uniform over the body, although the ridge of the spine and tail, back of the hind legs and the pads of the paws are always noticeably darker. Each hair has a light base with three or four bands of additional color growing darker towards the tip. The base color should be as clear as possible; any extensive intermingling with grey is considered a serious fault. A tendency to white on the chin is common but likewise must be minimal. The typical tabby M-shaped marking is often found on the forehead.

The breed's original color standard is a warm deep reddish-brown base with black ticking, known as "usual" in the United Kingdom, "tawny" in Australia, and "ruddy" elsewhere. Sorrel (also called cinnamon or red), a lighter coppery base with chocolate brown ticking, is a unique mutation of this original pattern. Other variants have been introduced by outcrossing to the Burmese and other shorthaired breeds, notably blue (on a warm beige base) and fawn (on a softer creamy peach base). The less common chocolate and lilac are not recognized in the Cat Fancier's Association (CFA) breed standard but have been granted full champion status in The International Cat Association (TICA) and in the UK. The UK also recognizes the Silver Abyssinian, in which the base coat is a pure silvery white with black (called "usual silver"), blue, cream or sorrel ticking. Various other color combinations are in development, including the "torbie", in which a patched tortoiseshell pattern in any of these colors is visible under the tabby banding.

The breed owes their distinctive coat to a dominant mutant gene known as Ta. In 2007, the first cat to have its entire genome published was an Abyssinian named Cinnamon.

          <h3>Behaviour</h3>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465338/1312/Cats/Abyssinian/Abykitten_psnmhn.jpg" alt="abbysinian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg" >

          <p>
            Veterinarian Joan O. Joshua has written that the "dog-like attachment to the owners" of Abyssinian and Burmese cats causes "greater dependence on human contacts". This stands in contrast to the mere "tolerant acceptance of human company" based around "comforts" that multiple other breeds display.

With their interest in playing with their owners combined with their curious intelligence, Abyssinians are sometimes called the "Clowns of the Cat Kingdom". They have soft chirrup-like vocalizations which do not sound like the expected "meow".

A study comparing Oriental, Siamese and Abyssinian kittens to Norwegian Forest cat kittens found that the former group was more likely to recede and hide as well as display other 'shy' behaviour.
          </p>
          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p>
            The breed can be prone to gingivitis, which can lead to more serious periodontitis. Familial renal amyloidosis or AA amyloidosis, a kidney disorder due to a mutation in the AA amyloid protein gene, has been seen in Abyssinians. The Abyssinian has had severe problems with blindness caused by a hereditary retinal degeneration due to mutations in the rdAc gene. However, the prevalence has been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008 in the country of Sweden. With the widespread availability of rdAc mutation detection tests and services, such as those provided by the UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, it is possible to reduce the disease frequency in all populations of Abyssinian. An Australian analysis found the Abyssinian to be over-represented in cases of feline infectious peritonitis when compared to the expected frequency based on census data (4.4% versus 1.5%). In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Abyssinian was significantly under-represented, with only one of the recorded cases belonging to an Abyssinian.

The 2008 study "The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations" by Lipinski et al. conducted at UC Davis by the team led by leading feline geneticist Dr Leslie Lyons found that the Abyssinian has a low level of genetic diversity, a heterozygosity value of 0.45 within a range of 0.34-0.69 for all breeds studied, and has genetic markers common to both Southeast Asian and Western breeds indicating that cats from both Asia and Europe were used to create the breed.

            <strong>Aegean cats</strong> (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου gáta tou Aigaíou) are a naturally occurring landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western Turkey. It is considered a natural cat, developing without human interference. Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465410/1312/Cats/Aegean/Aegean_Island_Cat_dwdy40.jpg" alt="Aegean_Island_Cat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
          <p>
            The Aegean cat, as its name suggests, originates from the Cycladic Islands in the Aegean Sea, where they occur as a natural landrace. Aegeans are considered one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds, cats having been introduced to the islands during the Bronze Age. They are common as feral cats in Greece and Turkey, where they are found amongst fishing ports asking for food offerings. In Greece, Aegean cats are considered a national treasure. Feral Aegean cats are notable predators of Aegean wall lizards in the Cyclades.
          </p>

          <h3>Aegean cats as pets</h3>
          <p>
            Although the Aegean has only very recently begun to be bred systematically, it has been domesticated for many centuries and thus has become adapted very well to humans. It is a social pet that tolerates living in an apartment rather well. It is intelligent, active, lively and also communicative, not hesitating to draw a person's attention. 
          </p>

          <h3>Aegean cat characteristics</h3>
          
          <p>
            Aegean cats are a medium-sized, muscular, semi-longhaired cat. The coat is bicolour or tricolour with one of the colours being almost always white. White usually takes up between 1/4 to 9/10 of the body. The colour of their coat might include many other colours and patterns. Their paws are medium in size and have a round shape. Their tail can be long and "hooked". The ears have a wide base and rounded tips and are covered by hair. The eyes have an almond shape and their color can be any shade of green, blue and yellow.

Aegean cats are noted for their affinity for water and fishing. Because the breed was allowed to develop through natural selection, rather than selective breeding, Aegean cats are free from most feline genetic diseases.

              The <strong>American Bobtail</strong>is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s.It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat.The breed is not related to other short-tailed breeds, such as the Cymric cat, or the Japanese Bobtail or Kurilian Bobtail, despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different, as the mutation causing the American Bobtail's short tail is dominant; comparatively, the Japanese Bobtail, for example, has a tail mutation that is recessive.

              American Bobtails are a very sturdy breed, with both short- and long-haired coats. Their coat is shaggy rather than dense or fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat, with a strong emphasis on the "wild" tabby appearance in show animals.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Urban legend says that Bobtails are the result of a cross breeding between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and may be related to the Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.

This cat's original appearance genetics were modified in the breed to form a new and improved strain which comes in essentially all colors and coat types. The breed was first recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA, US-based), in 1989. The breed has been accepted for championship competition by TICA, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA, also US-based) and the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). The breed is technically also sanctioned in the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all of ACFA's breed standards; it is unknown if any specimens are actually in China. The breed is "recognized" (as existing), as both American Bobtail Longhair and American Bobtail Shorthair, in the Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF), but is not "accepted" for competition and has no WCF breed standard.</p>
  
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              American Bobtails require two to three years to develop, slower than many domestic cat breeds.

While the typically “bobcat-“ or “ocelot”-like spotted coat patterning is the most basal coloration seen on the breed, many other colors and patterns exist (both in long and shorthair varieties), including black, blue, brindle, brown, calico, chocolate, cinnamon, fawn, lilac, pied, red-and-cream, peach or orange tabby or tortoiseshell, all with or without varying amounts of all-white fur on the chest, neck, legs or underside.

The American Bobtail is hearty, short-tailed cat. Its body is moderately long, with substantial boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The torso is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost as wide as chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to body. There is a concave curve from nose to brow, or rise to prominent brow, a broad unpinched muzzle, prominent whisker pads, a gently sloped wide nose and full, strong jaws. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and the side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape, with size proportionate to head. The aperture is angled to base of ear, and with medium wide spacing and deep sockets. Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.
 </p>
  
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            
            <p>
              American Bobtails are playful, social and some may be quite energetic, especially as kittens. They are considered to be highly adaptable to new environments, making them suitable companions for travelers. According to some sources, the American Bobtail is among the most “dog-like” of any cat breed, boldly greeting visitors to the home and never shying away from a potential opportunity to play, hunt or socialize. They have also been called miniature “ocelots”, at least in terms of their climbing abilities, and enjoy exploring, jumping, and stalking birds and small animals (even through windows). Overall, it is not a “sleepy” or reserved breed, though it still readily comes to humans and other cats and animals for affection, including dogs.

              The <strong>American Curl</strong>is a cat characterised by its unusual ears, which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. The breed originated in Lakewood, California, due to a spontaneous mutation.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The first American Curls appeared as strays on the doorstep of the Rugas in Lakewood, California in June 1981. The black female, named Shulamith, gave birth to a litter of cats with the same curled ears, and so became the ancestor of all American Curls today. In 1986, an American Curl was exhibited at a cat show for the first time, and in 1992, the longhaired American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became the first breed admitted to the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship Class with both longhair and shorthair divisions.
              The American Curl is a medium-sized cat 5-10 lb (2.3-4.5 kg), and does not reach maturity until 2-3 years of age. Females should be between 5-8 lb (2.3-3.6 kg) and males 7-10 lb (3.2-4.5 kg).

American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, which begin to curl within forty-eight hours. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer, and should be hard and stiff to the touch at the base of the ear with flexible tips. A pet-quality American Curl may have almost straight ears, but showcats must have ears that curl in an arc between 90 and 180 degrees. A 90 degrees is preferable, but cats will be disqualified if their ears touch the back of their skulls.

Both longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners and generally get along well with other animals and people who aren't their owners.

The American Curl, while still an uncommon breed, is found across the world in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and many other countries.  

            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465467/1312/Cats/Americal%20curl/ACL_Pointocurl_Fiorentina_gn4ghg.jpg" alt="American curl" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Due to its large genetic pool with non-pedigree cats, the American Curl is generally a healthy breed. However, their ears should be handled carefully, as rough handling may damage the cartilage in the ear, and require frequent cleaning to prevent infections.

              Various matings between cats with curled ears and cats without curled ears revealed a dominant inheritance of the curl gene. Sex-linked distribution was not found. The mutant gene was designated as curl and is symbolized by Cu. Another mutation of the ear pinna was found in Scottish Fold cats. In these cats both heterozygous and homozygous (FdFd) cats, animals suffer from osteochondrodysplasia. The question arises if homozygous curls (CuCu) could also be affected by cartilage formation defects and bone abnormalities. However, observations of a CuCu cat over two years showed no sign of anomaly.

              The <strong>American Shorthair</strong> is a breed of domestic cat believed to be descended from European cats brought to North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. According to the Cat Fanciers' Association, it was the eighth most popular pedigreed cat in the world for 2020.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              When settlers sailed from Europe to North America, they carried cats on board (ships' cats) to protect the stores from mice—for instance, the cats that came over on the Mayflower with the Pilgrims to hunt rats on the ship and in the colony. Many of these cats landed in the New World, interbred, and developed special characteristics to help them cope with their new life and climate. Early in the 20th century, a selective breeding program was established to develop the best qualities of these cats.

The American Shorthair is a pedigree cat breed, with a strict conformation standard, as set by cat fanciers of the breed and the North American cat fancier associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA) and the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally known as the Domestic Shorthair, the breed was renamed in 1966 to the "American Shorthair" to better represent its "all-American" origins and to differentiate it from other shorthaired breeds. The name "American Shorthair" also reinforces the fact that the breed is a pedigreed breed distinct from the random-bred non-pedigreed domestic short-haired cats in North America, which may nevertheless resemble the ASH. Both the American Shorthair breed and the random-bred cats from which the breed is derived are sometimes called working cats because they were used for controlling rodent populations, on ships and farms. The American shorthair (then referred as Domestic shorthair) was among the first five breeds that were considered as registered cat breeds by CFA during 1906.

              The American Shorthair is a medium to large sized cat breed with males weighing between 11-15 lbs (5-7 kg) and females weighing between 6-12 lbs (2.75-5.5kg). The head is large, resembling an oblong with more length than width. The ears are medium sized and slightly rounded at the tips. The eyes are large and wide. The neck is medium in length and well-muscled. The legs are medium in length and muscular. Tail is of medium length.

            <p>
              The American Shorthair is recognized in more than eighty different colors and patterns ranging from the brown-patched tabby to the blue-eyed white, the silvers (tabbies, shaded, smokes and cameos) to the calico van, and many colors in between. Some even come in deep tones of black, brown, or other blends and combinations. Generally, only cats showing evidence of crossbreeding resulting in the colors chocolate, sable, lilac (lavender), or the point-restricted pattern of the Siamese family are disqualified from being shown.

             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              A study in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 47% of tested American Shorthair cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the United States found that the American Shorthair had significantly lower odds of developing urate uroliths than mixed-breed cats.</p>

              The <strong>American Wirehair</strong> is a breed of domestic cat originating in Staten Island New York, which is characterized by its wiry fur and crinkly whiskers caused by a genetic mutation. As of 2017, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The American Wirehair is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among a litter of five born to a pair of barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The dominant genetic mutation, which causes the wirehair, was found to be different from the Rex mutation of other curly-coated breeds—such as the Cornish Rex or Devon Rex. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, to a look at the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Council Rock Farms Adams of Hi-Fi ('Adam' for short) and the female Tip-Top.
              Breeding between the two produced wirehaired kittens, many of which were sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada and Germany, where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              American Wirehairs are similar to American Shorthairs, with the exception of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. When evaluating this breed, the emphasis is mostly on the quality of the coat - out of a total of 100 points for quality coat, an American Wirehair can get 45. This type of coat is easy to maintain because the gene determining the hardness of the coat is dominant. The Wirehair coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a Wirehair and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.            </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              The Wirehair has an even, balanced temperament which is essentially identical to that of its American Shorthair relative. Wirehairs are equally content to play or fall asleep in their owners' laps. They have been described as cute and somewhat humorous. They are gentle and quiet, but also playful and active. They have quiet voices. American Wirehairs generally prefer to stay indoors.             
            </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              All cats carry the potential for genetic health issues, just like humans are susceptible to hereditary diseases. Be cautious of any breeder who claims their breed is entirely free of health or genetic problems; such statements may indicate misinformation or deception. Steer clear of breeders who don't provide health guarantees for kittens or assert that their breed is 100 percent healthy. Additionally, avoid those who claim their kittens are exempt from common health concerns.

              While the American Wirehair is generally healthy, it can share some health issues with the American Shorthair due to potential crossbreeding, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most prevalent feline heart disease. HCM leads to the thickening of the heart muscle, and its presence can be confirmed through an echocardiogram. Be skeptical of breeders who assert having HCM-free lines, as no guarantee exists against its development.
              
              Responsible breeders screen American Wirehairs for HCM, and those identified with the condition should be excluded from breeding programs. Ensure that you purchase a kitten from parents tested for this disease and consider obtaining it from breeders with a written health guarantee.
              
              After welcoming a new kitten into your home, you play a pivotal role in safeguarding her health. Obesity is a common issue, and maintaining the American Wirehair at an appropriate weight is crucial for overall well-being. Leverage preventive measures to ensure a healthy and thriving cat throughout her life.

              <strong>Cyprus cats</strong>, also know as <strong>Cypriot cats</strong>, <strong>Saint Helen cats</strong> and <strong>Saint Nicholas cat</strong> are a landrace of domestic cat found across the island of Cyprus. A standardized breed is being developed from them; among cat fancier and breeder organizations, it is presently fully recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF), with breeding regulated by the World Cat Congress (WCC), under the name Aphrodite's Giant; and provisionally by The International Cat Association (TICA) as the Aphrodite. All three organizations permit shorthaired and semi-longhaired versions and no out-crossing to other breeds.

              The earliest known written record of cats on Cyprus refers to a story of Saint Helen of Constantinople sending two boatloads of cats to a monastery on the island from Egypt or Israel in the 4th century AD to deal with an infestation of snakes. Cats on Cyprus have been able to breed for centuries with comparatively little outside influence; this has resulted in a distinct, locally adapted variety of cat which appears to have developed as a feral population in the inner highlands, though is found throughout the island in modern times. While wildcats in association with humans on Cyprus date to at least 7500 BC - the earliest proven association of cats with humans - there is no known connection between those ancient tamed-wild specimens and modern domesticated Cyprus cats, despite breeder claims to the contrary.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              A paper by J.-D. Vigne, et al., concluded in 2004 that the discovery of Near Eastern wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) remains in a 9,500-year-old grave in Cyprus is the oldest example to date of a cat in close association with humans. Archaeologists led by Jean Guillain working at the Neolithic site of Shillourokambos uncovered carefully interred remains of a cat alongside human remains and decorative artifacts, on an island separated from the mainland since before human habitation, thus indicating human introduction of cats to the area. "Examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out, and the body of the cat was placed in it, then rapidly covered." The cat skeleton pre-dates Egyptian depictions of cats by 4,000 years or more. There is no evidence that modern cats of any variety are descended from ancient Cypriot wildcats; nevertheless both WCF and TICA have uncritically repeated breeder claims of such descent.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465453/1312/Cats/Aphrodite%20Giant/Cyprus_Cat_Yawning_rixd4y.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Cyprus cats of today are more likely linked with the monastery named Saint Nicholas of the Cats (Greek: Άγιος Νικόλαος των Γατών, romanized: Ágios Nikólaos ton Gatón), which was founded in the 4th century AD. It is located near Akrotiri. According to Byzantine legend, Helena of Constantinople (Saint Helen) shipped hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine to Cyprus in 328 AD to control venomous snakes that had infested the area around the monastery, following a drought lasting 37 years. The monastery had two bells, one to call the cats to meals and the other to send them into the fields to hunt snakes. The population of cats at the site (today a nunnery) once dwindled, but has now revived thanks to care by the resident nuns. The Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis wrote of these cats in his poem "The Cats of St. Nicholas". The story being a legend, it is impossible to know for certain today if shiploads of cats were really sent to Cyprus in the 4th century and cats have, of course, been arriving on the island (often as ship's cats) for many centuries.
            </p>

            <p>
              The World Cat Congress is of the opinion that Cyprus cats developed over time in mountainous inner Cyprus from various populations of cats around the island and became large and bushy-haired to cope with hunting comparatively large prey like rats, big lizards and snakes in cool, wet, mountain weather, though summers there are fairly hot and dry (Both WCF and TICA note that the thickness of the coat in purebred Aphrodite cats descended from this populations still varies seasonally). The other two organizations' breed summaries are generally consistent with this view, though it is uncertain who first produced this account of their origin, or on what basis. It is unclear whether Cyprus cats are closely related to the broader Aegean cat landrace of mainland and island Greece. Genetic testing to date (see below) has shown only that the Cyprus cats are distinct enough that a breed could be developed from them.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              Cyprus cats are somewhat thick-haired (from short-haired up to "semi-longhaired" in cat fanciers' jargon), and are an athletic and energetic variety. Feral populations are found throughout the island of Cyprus, from mountainous and cooler regions to the lower, hotter areas near the coasts, including in the cities. As such, this cat has locally adapted to different climates / seasonal change; however, it may be more associated with the mountainous areas.            </p>

          
             <h3>Aphrodite breed development</h3>
             <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465452/1312/Cats/Aphrodite%20Giant/Cyprus-Cat-Cape-Greco_xm3kzu.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              Local breeders began in 2006 to attempt to establish a standardized breed from local feral cats. In 2008, a World Cat Federation (WCF) all-breeds judge visited Cyprus to work at a cat show and was introduced to a breeder of purebred cats developed in this trial breeding program from the Cyprus cats. Considering the cats distinct, he wrote a standard of points and named them Aphrodite Giant. The president and board members of WCF advised that these Aphrodite cats should be shown outside Cyprus to become better known within the cat fancy, but did not immediately accept the nascent breed. Subsequently, a group of interested people in Cyprus decided to form a club, which was named the Cyprus Cats National Breed Association (CyCNBA), which applied for government approval and started functioning in late 2009. CyCNBA applied to affiliate to the WCF in April 2012.

In addition, it was agreed that a letter be sent to a leading specialist in cat genetics, Leslie A. Lyons of University of California, Davis, asking whether she would agree to DNA-test a selection of Cyprus cats to see whether it was possible to genetically define them as a breed. The professor, who intended shortly to begin a further study of Turkish Van and Turkish Angora cats (whose ancestry has long been disputed), agreed to study samples submitted from Cyprus. A total of 248 cats were studied, including a number of random-bred Cyprus cats from the Malcolm Cat Sanctuary, for comparison. "All cats were considered in one large analysis. The analysis partitioned the cats based solely on genetic variation, not by any other identification." (L. Lyons - 2 January 2012) The January 2012 report concluded that "Cyprus cats are a distinct population within the Mediterranean" and that a "breed from Cyprus could be developed".

On 1 July 2012, the cat became a fully recognised breed of the WCF, originally as just the Aphrodite's Giant Longhair (though it is actually in the organization's semi-longhaired division,) after the CyCNBA attended the WCF General Assembly in Gelsenkirchen, Germany and applied for recognition of the cats in April 2012. Today, WCF also recognizes a short-haired variant.

In September 2017, The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the cats, under the name Aphrodite, as a "preliminary new breed", in its own breed group and with both shorthaired and semi-longhaired varieties. Some TICA members have started breeding programs for the Aphrodite in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

In breeder terminology, this constitutes a natural or traditional breed - one developed from local stock to preserve its key characteristics, rather than created by breeders to have new features.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed standards</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465454/1312/Cats/Aphrodite%20Giant/CyprusShorthair_l28xlh.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The WCF standard calls for the Aphrodite's Giant to be large, strong, and muscular but not cobby, and big-boned even as kittens. The cats may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and of any colors other than colorpoint or mink (which comes from the Burmese gene), nor with any white spots if otherwise solid-colored. "In bicolour, non-regular colour setting is desired." The coat should be soft and wooly, and is expected to be longer and with an undercoat in winter, and always lacking any top coat except possibly on the back. In detail, WCF calls for muscular hips and shoulders; back legs slightly longer than front (a trait shared with another insular breed, the Manx); medium-long, "well-plumed" tail, commensurate with body size (and visibly tapering in the shorthaired version); a long-triangular head with straight cheeks, long and straight muzzle, "strong" chin, rounded front of the face, slightly domed forehead and "a very slight dip under the height of the eyes"; wide-based, medium-large ears, forming an open V (rather than being straight upward); and olive-shaped, oblique-set eyes of any uniform color. Weight range is not specified.

WCF has set no temperament or breeding rules for this breed, and defers on breeding points instead to the World Cat Congress (WCC), which permits no out-crossing, other than between the longhaired and shorthaired varieties of the breed. Only WCC (a confederation of national and international cat federations, which does not itself issue breed standards, just breeding regulations) uses the term Aphrodite's Giant Shorthair for the latter. WCC asks that judges disqualify smaller specimens of both, to preserve the large-boned nature of the breed.
</p>
<p>
Under the TICA definition, Aphrodites may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and have any color and pattern, except they may not be colorpoint or mink and should not have a "locket" spot on the chest. The coat should be soft and lush and may seasonally vary in undercoat density (not required). They are "athletic, well-muscled, solid" and of medium to large build, but must have a gentle, non-aggressive temperament. Fully adult male weight range is 15-18 pounds (6.8-8.2 kg); female, 10-14 pounds (4.5-6.4 kg), which is heavy for a female cat. On finer points, the TICA standard calls for hips and shoulders of the same width; back legs slightly longer than front; an overall long-triangular, straight-cheeked head with a squared but not flattened muzzle and slight concavity between nose and brow leading to a slightly rounded forehead; wide-based, wide-set and fairly large ears forming an open V; oblique, olive-shaped eyes of any color; a full-width chin of normal depth; medium-long, tapering tail consistent with the body and coat (and plumed in the longhaired version). Jowls are permitted in adult males. No out-crossing to other cats is permitted (though the two varieties of Aphrodite are a single breed for TICA purposes).
</p>
<p>
WCF and TICA sharply conflict with each other on the cat's speed of maturity, perhaps owing to different foundation stock for their breed variants. The WCF standard says that they develop quickly, while TICA says they are comparatively slow to mature (another trait shared with the Manx), taking three to five years to reach full size.

TICA's overview of the breed describes them as affectionate and social and in some ways dog-like in behavior toward their keepers.

              The <strong>Arabian Mau</strong> is a formal breed of domestic cat, originated from the early African wildcat, a short-haired landrace native to the Arabian Peninsula. It lives in the streets of the Arabian Peninsula and has adapted very well to its climate. The Arabian Mau is recognized as a formal breed by few fancier and breeder organization and cat registry, World Cat Federation (WCF) and Emirates Feline Federation (EFF). Based on one landrace, the Arabian Mau is a natural breed.

              It is medium in size, with a body structure that is rather large and firm, not particularly slender, and with well-developed musculature. The legs are comparatively long, with oval paws.
              </p>
              <p>
              The head appears round but is slightly longer than broad. The nose is slightly concave curved when viewed in profile. The whisker pads are clearly pronounced, with a slight pinch. The chin is very firm. The eyes are slightly oval, large and slightly slanted. The cat may have any normal cat eye color. There is no relation between the eye and coat colors. Usually, Arabian Maus have bright green eyes. The ears are large, slightly forward and sideward-placed, a little long, and high-set on the skull.
              
              While Arabian Maus are not technically hypoallergenic, its low propensity for shedding and dander production may cause lesser reactions in those with mild allergies.

            <p>
              The breed has been a landrace native to the Arabian peninsula in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates for more than 1,000 years. Desert cats are well adapted to the hot environment of parts of Arabia
            </p>
            <h3>Grooming</h3>

            <p>
              Arabian Mau have short fur without an undercoat and as such, are not high shedders. They are very capable of keeping themselves neatly groomed. This makes grooming for the owner quite easy. While not always necessary, brushing will remove dead hairs and intensify the beautiful gloss of the coat.            
            </p>

          
             <h3>Standard Arabian Mau</h3>

             <p>
              Females are medium-sized and elegant; however, males can be much larger and have muscular bodies. Their legs are long with perfectly oval paws. The tail has medium length with tapering toward the tip. The head appears to be round, but it is slightly longer than broad with well-defined whisker pads. Ears are large and well set. Their eyes are oval and match the coat color. The fur is short and has no undercoat, besides it lying close to the body. The coat should not be silky. The colors can be different but the most recognized are red, white, black, and brown tabby.

The Arabian Mau cat breed is a natural breed, so it must reflect the morphology and behavioral features of the cats living on the Arabian Peninsula. The standard has been drafted on the observation and the description of physical characteristics, which have been found in the cats of this area average population, originating from the Middle East and in its descendants. No prefixed model has been followed.

The Arabian Mau cats were approved by the WCF during the Annual General Meeting held on August 2-3, 2008 in Germany. The Arabian Mau cats have been able to participate in international shows since January 1, 2009.

              The <strong> Asian</strong> or <strong> Asian group</strong>is a cat breed similar to the European Burmese but in a range of different coat colours and patterns. Long-haired Asians of all varieties are called Tiffanies. Asians are grouped in section 5 (Burmese) by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was accidentally developed in the United Kingdom, starting with a litter of 4 kittens resulting from a mismating of a chinchilla Persian stud, Jamari Sanquist, and a lilac European Burmese queen, Bambino Lilac Faberge, bred in 1981 by Baroness Miranda von Kirchberg.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              After the first litter of kittens were born in 1981, breeders believed the kittens showed potential to become their own breed. Early breeders decided the phenotype of the kittens was to be exactly the same as the Burmese, but in more colours and varieties. All varieties gained championship status with the GCCF in 2003, with the Tiffanie being the last variety to gain it
             </p>

            <h3>Asian group</h3>
            <p>
              In appearance, the Asian group is essentially identical to the Burmese breed, but they come in more colours and patterns, and in the case of the Tiffanies (Asian semi-longhairs), longer fur. Smoke is the term used for self/solid coloured silvers (uniform distribution), while shaded and tipped silvers are silver tabbies (distribution in tabby pattern) with 'wide banding'. The Asian group incorporates the:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>Asian Bombay</li>
              <li>Asian Shaded or Burmilla (silver or golden shaded and tipped)</li>
              <li>Asian Smoke (smoke),</li>
              <li>Asian Tabby (tabby),</li>
              <li>Tiffanie or Asian (semi-)longhair (longhair variety).</li>
             </ul>

             <h3>Asian Smoke</h3>
             <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465459/1312/Cats/Asian/smoke_ufmo8k.jpg" alt="Asian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              The Asian Smoke is a non-agouti cat with a white undercoat that is not always noticeable. When the Asian was originally being developed Burmillas were bred with Burmese. These cats were given the name 'Burmoire' due to the moire-like effect of their coats — this look is now considered undesirable for the Asian Smoke.
             </p>

              <h3>Asian Shaded or Burmilla (silver or golden shaded and tipped)</h3>
              <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465458/1312/Cats/Asian/Male_Burmilla_cat_doa97z.jpg" alt="Asian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

              <p>
The Asian Shaded (also known as the Burmilla) has two colours at the tip and at the root of their fur.
              </p>
              
              
              <h3>Bombay,</h3>              
              <p>
                The solid black Bombay under the Asian Self-category has a slightly different origin, but is also developed in the UK. In the early 1980's, the resulting kittens of three mismatings of European Burmese with black domestic short-haired cats were developed into the British-type Bombay.
                
                Additionally, there exist another variant of the Bombay cat, the American-type Bombay developed in the United States. American-type Bombays were developed by crossbreeding sable American Burmese and black American Shorthair cats, to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat and exclusively with bright copper-golden eyes. For the British-type Bombay golden eyes are preferred, but yellow through to green is acceptable, with the preference given to greater depth of colour.              
              </p>
              <h3>Asian Tabby (tabby),</h3>
              <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465458/1312/Cats/Asian/tabby_b2xxy8.jpg" alt="Asian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

              <p>
                The Asian Tabby is an Asian cat with tabby markings. However unlike regular tabbies the coat has a reduced melanin concentration which results in lighter tabby markings. Asian Tabbies come in all four traditional tabby markings and most tabby colourings.

              <h3>Tiffanie or Asian (semi-)longhair (longhair variety).</h3>

              <p>
                The Tiffanie (Unrelated to the Chantilly-Tiffany) also known as the Asian Semi-longhair is an Asian cat with medium to long length hair.
              </p>




             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              Ancestral breeds of the Asian have been known to carry Polycystic Kidney Disease and Progressive retinal atrophy, however, only Burmese Hypokalaemia has been identified in the Asian.

Many Asian breeders and their cats were involved in the research into the disease, and as of 2018 all registered breeders with the Asian Cat Association are required to test for hypokalaemia for all Asian group cats intended for use in breeding.

              The <strong>Tiffanie</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465450/1312/Cats/Tiffanie/IMGP3621__52342024792_luac8b.jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>American Mist</strong> (formerly known as Spotted Mist) is a breed of cat developed in Australia. It is a cross between the Abyssinian cat, the Burmese cat, and the Australian Tabby cat. The Australian Mist has a distinct and unique coat pattern hence the name.
             </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              This breed was developed in Australia in 1977 by Dr. Truda Straede with a gene-pool of approximately 30 foundation cats. Dr. Straede submitted a plan to the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW Cat Control (RASCC) for a breed with blue, brown, chocolate, and lilac colourings by using Burmese; and for a spotted tabby pattern by using the ticking gene of Abyssinian to go with a spotted tabby coat. The first generation of the breed was accepted into the RASCC experimental category in May of 1980 and in April of 1986 the fourth generation was accepted as the 'Spotted Mist'. In June of 1997 the marbled variety of the breed was accepted by the RASCC and Waratah State Cat Alliance. Due to the newly accepted marbled variety it was decided by the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia and the Australian Cat Fancy to rename the breed — in a unanimous decision the name 'Australian Mist' was chosen.
             </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              On January the 1st 1999 the breed received champsion status with the New Zealand Cat Fancy. The breed was accepted for championship status by the World Cat Federation in August 2004. The first Australian Mists were imported into the United Kingdom in 2007. The breed was given prelimary recognition by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in October of 2011. It was accepted at championship status in TICA (The International Cat Association) on 1 May 2014. It gained championship status with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in February 2017. The breed is not yet recognized by the Fédération Internationale Féline.

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Australian Mist is a medium-sized short-haired cat, with a round and medium-sized head, a broad nose, and large green eyes. Eye colour can range from chartreuse to aquamarine. Ears are moderately large with a rounded tip to them. The coat is short to medium in length and feels smooth and silky.

   </p>

   <h3>Distributon</h3>

            <p>
              Due to the novel status of the breed outside Australia most Australian Mist catteries are located in Australia; however, there are a few in the UK and USA. Breeding cats have also been sent to Norway.
   </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              The following conditions are commonly screened for in breeding Australian Mist cats — Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency, Hypokalaemic Polymyopathy, Neonatal Isoerythrolysis, and Progressive Retinal Atrophy.

              The <strong>Balinese</strong> is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed and hence is essentially the same cat but with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail.
            </p>
            <p>
              As is the case with their short-haired counterparts, a genetic distinction is made between traditional or "old-style" and modern body types. In the American standard, color variants derived from the Colorpoint Shorthair are further considered a separate breed, known as the Javanese. There is no particular connection between these cats and the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java, from which they derive their names.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like their Siamese ancestors, Balinese are sociable, vocal, playful, inquisitive, and intelligent.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The "Balinese" is not actually from Bali or any part of Indonesia. Its history begins with the first Siamese cats that were imported from Thailand to the U.S. and U.K. in the mid-1800s, some of whom carried the recessive long-haired gene. The Balinese breed subsequently originated from deliberate breeding efforts based on this naturally expressed genetic trait.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, occasional long-haired kittens in Siamese litters were considered a fault in the bloodline and sold exclusively as pets. There are records of these cats as early as the 1900s; "Long-haired Siamese" were first registered as show cats with the American Cat Fanciers' Federation in 1928. In the mid-1950s, breeders in the US began serious efforts to develop the long-haired variant as a separate breed. Considering Long-haired Siamese too cumbersome a name, initial breeder Helen Smith dubbed the new breed "Balinese" as a reference to the grace of Balinese dancers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A breeder named Sylvia Holland (who was also an illustrator for Walt Disney Studios) worked to further establish the breed standard in the 1960s and 1970s. She recognized only cats showing the classic Siamese points in seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac as true Balinese, refusing to accept others because they had likely originated from crosses with other breeds. The American Cat Fanciers' Association had meanwhile officially classified Siamese with the newer red and cream as well as lynx (tabby) and tortoiseshell (or "tortie") patterned points as a separate breed, the Colorpoint Shorthair, and the long-haired cats derived from these colors and patterns were subsequently likewise classified separately as "Javanese", in keeping with the Indonesian island theme.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like their Siamese ancestors, the Balinese gradually split into two separate varieties based on physical type. The traditional Siamese (also called old-style or "apple-head", now being separately developed as the Thai), was the type in vogue when the Balinese was established, and hence used in its development; these old-style Balinese still closely resemble those from the early breeding programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the parent short-haired Siamese gained in popularity, however, a trend developed in favor of a more extremely elongated, slender type with a distinctively wedge-shaped head. The modern (or "contemporary") Balinese was subsequently derived directly from this newer Siamese ideal. By the mid-1980s, the old-style Balinese, like their Siamese counterparts, had disappeared from most cat shows, except a few breeders who maintained the original Balinese type. The two varieties of Balinese thus have very few if any recent ancestors in common.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707606424/1312/Cats/Balinese/Ghislaine_6028_hgeyps.jpg" alt="Balinese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <h3>Balinese-Javanese</h3>
            <p>
              There was discussion in the Cat Fanciers' Association about merging the two breeds into one breed with two color divisions as early as 2006. The Javanese is a hybrid between Colorpoint Shorthair and Balinese. In 2008, breeders in the Balinese Breed Council and Javanese Breed Council voted to combine the Balinese and Javanese as one breed and declared Javanese as a color division of the Balinese. The Cat Fanciers' Association was the only organization to believe that Javanese was a separate breed. This does not affect the colors or description of Balinese, since they are two separate divisions but they are just placed under the Balinese. Javanese will still have the same colors as before, along with Balinese having the same colors mentioned below.
            </p>
            <p>
              This movement has brought The Cat Fanciers' Association more in line with the other worldwide registries. The Cat Fanciers' Association made this change since the two councils in their organization (Balinese and Javanese) were overlapping around an average of 50 to 75% with the same members who breed and exhibited the two types. It is hoped that combining the two breeds will increase Balinese registration in the Cat Fanciers' Association, by encouraging new breeders and exhibitors of Balinese to come forth and present their cat. They also wished to show more Javanese of the appropriate coat length in the shows. This will also help decrease the number of cats needed to maintain a healthy breeding program.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The two types of Balinese are still analogous to their Siamese counterparts. While both are relatively slender, graceful fine-boned cats with long legs and tails, neat oval paws, almond-shaped eyes, and large pointed ears, the traditional type is overall the more substantial, with a broader head and sturdier body. The modern type features a noticeably more wedge-shaped head with long tapering muzzle and longer, broader ears, atop a more slender and elongated body.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Coat and color</h3>
            
            <p>
              The coat is medium-length (although there can be considerable variance by individual) and should be soft and silky, without the fluffy undercoat typical of most long-haired breeds. The offspring of two Balinese will have a longer coat than that of a Balinese and a Siamese. In all cases, the tail should have a definite plume, or fringe, of longer hair. Eye color ranges from pale blue through sapphire/violet; the intensity of color can change slightly with age and diet. The paw pad color can be used to identify the color point in kittens. Pink pads are found in chocolate and lilac points; while dark pads are found in blue and seal points.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Like all cats with the point pattern, Balinese kittens are born pure cream or white and gradually develop visible points in colder parts of their body - the face, ears, paws and tail. Their color is identifiable by the time they are four weeks old. Some cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Balinese cats living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Cat Fanciers' Federation and most other associations worldwide accept the Balinese breed in seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream point, besides tortoiseshell and lynx points in all of these colors. The Cat Fanciers' Association standard continues to accept the Balinese in only the classic seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac points, with all other possible colors and patterns classed separately as Javanese.

            <h3>
              Temperament
            </h3>
            <p>
              Balinese share the traits of the short-haired Siamese, and hence are notably social and playful cats with an intense interest in the activity around them and a tendency to vocalize often and persistently, albeit at a lower volume. They are reputed to have the highest intelligence of all the long-haired breeds. They are also reputed to be notably acrobatic and to enjoy intimate contact with their owners.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hypoallergenic claims</h3>
            <p>
              Anecdotally, many people claim that Balinese cats cause fewer problems with allergies than most cat breeds. While strict scientific evidence for this is lacking, it has been determined that, in comparison to most cats, the Balinese produce very low amounts of the Fel d1 and Fel d4 protein allergens. As with the Siberian cat breed, some Balinese breeders and clubs are working together to produce more rigorously tested evidence of the Balinese's hypoallergenic quality.
            </p>

            <h3>Genetics</h3>
            <p>
              The pointed pattern  is a form of partial albinism, resulting from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin. This results in dark coloration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses. Though crossbreeding with other breeds took place to produce the less traditional Javanese colors, they are considered purebred cats if they are registered and have at least 3-4 or more generations of Siamese or Balinese lineage.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              They are considered a healthy breed with only a few health problems. They are a pedigree breed, which means they are developed from such a small gene pool of Siamese with the long hair mutation. The smaller the gene pool, the more chances they have to inherit many unknown health disorders. A possible confirmed disease for Balinese is Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), which is a degeneration of the retina in the eye; that may lead to weak or impaired vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              There have been some cases of Balinese having dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a disease that enlarges the heart muscles and decreases heart function. There are also some claims that they are at a low risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another potential health problem is liver amyloidosis, or systemic amyloidosis which eventually leads to the failure of some organs, most commonly the liver. Liver amyloidosis typically occurs in any members of the Siamese and the Balinese is a mutation of the Siamese, so it may have any inherited disorders directly to the Siamese.
            </p>
            <p>
              They sometimes developed a rare inheritance that makes their blue almond-shaped eyes look cross-eyed. It is called Strabismus, which is common in Siamese cat breeds.

              The <strong>Bambino</strong>  is a breed of cat that was created as a cross between the Sphynx and the Munchkin breeds. The Bambino cat has short legs and is hairless.

              
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1706465460/1312/Cats/Bambino/bambino-cat-free-puic-Google-Search_uhohuz.png" alt="Bambino" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 2005, The International Cat Association (TICA) records Bambinos as an experimental breed For tracking purposes, TICA will record any cat breeding under the category “experimental registry”. This is separate from the approved breeds that have met the health and genetics requirements to be shown. Bambinos are unable to be shown as a breed in TICA.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are recognised by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry (REFR). However, most major cat registries do not recognise the Bambino cat breed. Several countries prohibited the breeding of Bambinos by law, due to their genetic health concerns.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The first litter of Bambino kittens was registered in 2005 by The International Cat Association (TICA) as an experimental breed.

              Bambino in Italian translates to "baby", referring to the cat's appearance of making it look like a kitten. The Bambino has short legs it inherits from the Munchkin, and huge upright ears, as well as having the hairlessness of the Sphynx.    
             </p>
            <h3>Breed concerns</h3>

            <p>
              Due to the concern of animal welfare, the breeding of Bambino cats is not legal in all countries. Some examples of Bambino breeding restrictions are Germany and the Federal German Animal Protection Act of 1999, and in the Netherlands it is forbidden since 2014 to breed with parent animals which have a genetic disease, such as the Bambino cat. This law falls under the control of the Dutch inspection authorities of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

              Apart from TICA, most of the major cat registries do not allow the registry of the Bambino breed, nor recognise it due to concerns about their welfare. Among others, the breed is not recognised by:            
            </p>

            <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The wrinkled hairless appearance and short legs are the breed's two most distinctive features. Though Bambinos can be coated with fur, this, however, is referred to as a "coated Bambino".

              The back legs can be slightly longer than the front legs. The body is medium to long, with a broad chest and a well-rounded abdomen. Boning is medium. The whippy tail is in good proportion to the rest of the body. Some Bambinos can have a "lion tail"—a puff of hair on the tail tip. The head is a modified wedge with rounded lines, slightly longer than wide. As well as in the Sphynx, the cheekbones and whisker pads are very prominent. The whiskers are sparse and short. The chin is firm. The eyes are large, rounded, and wide spaced. The large ears are set upright, neither too low nor too high. The cat's size and physical qualities do not hamper its movements.           
             </p>
             <p>
              Their weight is typically 5 to 9 pounds (2.3 to 4.1 kg).
             </p>

             <h3>
              Coat and grooming
             </h3>
             <p>
              Even though some Bambinos appear hairless, they typically are covered with a fine downy fur. Their wrinkled skin feels like chamois or suede to the touch. Regular grooming is necessary to remove sebaceous secretions from the skin, and baths are recommended. If grooming and bathing aren't done on a regular basis, the Bambino can become excessively dirty, oily, and sticky to the touch and/or develop skin conditions.

The Bambino skin is vulnerable to temperature and sun, and they must be kept as an indoor cat. Contrary to popular belief, Bambino cats are not hypoallergenic.
             </p>

             <h3>Genetics and health</h3>
             <p>
              Bambino is called a mutation breed because it is a breed that requires both recessive mutations for the hairless gene, and dominant mutations for the dwarfed limbs. Mutation breeding can be disastrous to the health of the produced kitten, if not done by an experienced breeder.

Typically Bambino litters produce both kittens that resemble and do not resemble the parents, and which can result in litters of short-legged and long-legged kittens, as the Bambino genetics are heterozygous for the short leg gene. Bambino litters cannot produce furry kittens as the hairless gene is recessive, and so each bambino has two copies of the hairless gene.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the breed is new, more research needs to be done to confirm the presence or absence of possible genetic health issues. However, common health problems typical of the related Munchkin breed of cat are well-known, the most common being an above higher average of lordosis (excessive curvature of the spine) and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest).

The Bambino breed is prone to developing bacterial skin conditions and infections due to the hairlessness and skin folds, as well as an inability to regulate the oiliness of their skin.

              The <strong>Bengal</strong> The Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing of a Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. The breed's name derives from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bengals have a wild appearance; their golden shimmer comes from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling. They are an energetic breed that needs much exercise and play.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The earliest mention of an Asian leopard cat x domestic cross was in 1889, when Harrison Weir wrote of them in Our Cats and All About Them             
            </p>
            <p>
              Jean Mill of California is given credit for the modern Bengal breed. She made the first known deliberate cross of an Asian leopard cat with a domestic cat (a black California tomcat). Bengals as a breed did not really begin in earnest until much later.

            </p>
            <p>
              Bengal cats from the first three generations of breeding (F1, G2, and G3) are considered "foundation" or "early-generation" Bengals. The early-generation males are frequently infertile. Therefore, female early-generation Bengals are bred to fertile domestic Bengal males of later generations. Nevertheless, as the term was used incorrectly for many years, many people and breeders still refer to the cats as F2, F3, and F4, even though the term is considered incorrect.
            </p>

            <h3>Cat registries</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707606870/1312/Cats/Bengal/1920px-Best_Stalk_ur60gn.jpg" alt="Bengal" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
In 1986, the breed was accepted as a "new breed" by The International Cat Association; Bengals gained TICA championship status in 1991. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) accepted Bengal cats in 1997. Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) in 1999 accepted the bered into their registry. Also in 1999, Bengals were accepted into the Australian Cat Federation (ACF). The Cat Fanciers' Association accepted the Bengal in CFA's "Miscellaneous" in 2016, under the restrictions that "it must be F6 or later (6 generations removed from the Asian leopard cat or non-Bengal domestic cat ancestors)".
            </p>
            <h3>Early generations</h3>
            <p>
              Bengal cats from the first three generations of breeding (F1, G2, and G3) are considered "foundation" or "early-generation" Bengals. The early-generation males are frequently infertile. Therefore, female early-generation Bengals are bred to fertile domestic Bengal males of later generations. Nevertheless, as the term was used incorrectly for many years, many people and breeders still refer to the cats as F2, F3, and F4, even though the term is considered incorrect.
            </p>

            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              The Bengal breed was more fully developed by the 1980s. "In 1992 The International Cat Association had 125 registered Bengal Breeders." By the 2000s, Bengals had become a very popular breed. In 2019, there were nearly 2,500 Bengal breeders registered in TICA worldwide.           
             </p>
            <h3>Legal restrictions</h3>
            <p>
              In Australia, G5 (fifth-generation) Bengals are not restricted, but their import is complex.

Bengals were regulated in the United Kingdom. In 2007, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs removed the previous licensing requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the United States, legal restrictions and even bans sometimes exist at the state and municipal level. In Hawaii, Bengal cats are prohibited by law (as are all wild cat species, and all other hybrids of domestic and wild animals). In Connecticut, it is also illegal to own any generation of Bengal cat. In Alaska, Bengal cats must be four generations removed from the Asian leopard cat. A permit and registered pedigree that indicates the previous four generations are required. In California, the code of regulations Title 14, section K, Asian leopards are not specifically listed as a restricted species. In Delaware, a permit is required to own Bengal cats. Bengals of the F1-G4 generations are also regulated in New York state, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Indiana. Various cities have imposed restrictions; in New York City, Bengals are prohibited, and there are limits on Bengal ownership in Seattle, Washington, and in Denver, Colorado. Except where noted above, Bengal cats with a generation of G5 and beyond are considered domestic, and are generally legal in the US.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a major concern in the Bengal cat breed. This is a disease in which the heart muscle (myocardium) becomes abnormally thick (hypertrophied). A thick heart muscle can make it harder for the cat's heart to pump blood. The only way to determine the suitability of Bengal cats meant for breeding is to have the cat's heart scanned by a cardiologist.
            </p>
            <p>
              HCM is a common genetic disease in Bengal cats and there is no genetic testing available as of 2018. In the United States, the current practice of screening for HCM involves bringing Bengal cats to a board certified veterinary cardiologist where an echocardiogram is completed. Bengal cats that are used for breeding should be screened annually to ensure that no hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is present. Currently North Carolina State University is attempting to identify genetic markers for HCM in the Bengal Cat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bengal cats are known to be affected by several genetic diseases, one of which is Bengal progressive retinal atrophy, also known as Bengal PRA or PRA-b. Anyone breeding Bengal cats should carry out this test, since it is inexpensive, noninvasive, and easy to perform. A breeder stating their cats are "veterinarian tested" should not be taken to mean that this test has been performed by a vet: it is carried out by the breeder, outside of a vet office (rarely, if ever, by a vet). The test is then sent directly to the laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>
              PK deficiency is a common genetic diseases found in Bengal Cats. PK deficiency is another test that is administered by the breeder. Breeding Bengal Cats should be tested before breeding to ensure two PK deficiency carriers are not mated. This is a test that a breeder must do on their own. A breeder uses a cotton swab to rub the inside of the cat's mouth and then mails the swab to the laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>
              A unique form of ulcerative dermatitis affecting the nasal planum (rhinarium or nose leather) of Bengal cats was first reported in 2004. The condition first presents between the ages of 4-12 months, beginning as a dry scale and progressing to crusts and fissures typical of hyperkeratosis. The exact cause remains unclear; it is considered hereditary and incurable, but can respond favorably to topical steroid treatments such as prednisolone and tacrolimus ointment.
            </p>
            <h3>Bengal blood type</h3>
            <p>
              The UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory has studied domestic cat blood types. They conclude that most domestic cats fall within the AB system. The common blood types are A and B and some cats have the rare AB blood type. There is a lack of sufficient samples from Bengals, so the genetics of the AB blood group in Bengal cats is not well understood.
            </p>
            <p>
              One Bengal blood type study that took place in the U.K. tested 100 Bengal cats. They concluded that all 100 of the Bengal cats tested had type A blood.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Shedding and grooming
            </h3>
            <p>
              Bengals are often claimed by breeders and pet adoption agencies to be a hypoallergenic breed - one less likely to cause an allergic reaction. The Bengal cat is said to produce lower than average levels of allergens, though this has not been scientifically proven as of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cat geneticist Leslie Lyons, who runs the University of Missouri's Feline and Comparative Genetics Laboratory, discounts such claims, observing that there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic cat. Alleged hypoallergenic breeds thus may still produce a reaction among those who have severe allergies.
            </p>
            <h3>Bengal Longhair (Cashmere Bengal)</h3>
            <p>
              Some long-haired Bengals (more properly, semi-long-haired) have always occurred in Bengal breeding. Many different domestic cats were used to create the Bengal breed, and it is theorized that the gene for long hair came from one of these backcrossings. UC Davis has developed a genetic test for long hair so that Bengal breeders could select Bengal cats with a recessive long-hair gene for their breeding programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some Bengal cats used in breeding can carry a recessive gene for long-haired. When a male and female Bengal each carry a copy of the recessive long hair gene, and those two Bengals are mated with each other, they can produce long-haired Bengals. (See Cat coat genetics#Genes involved in fur length and texture.) In the past, long-haired offspring of Bengal matings were spayed or neutered until some breeders chose to develop the long-haired Bengal (which are sometimes called a Cashmere Bengal).
            </p>
            <p>
              Long-haired Bengals are starting to gain more recognition in some cat breed registries but are not widely accepted. Since 2013, they have "preliminary" breed status in the New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) registry, under the breed name Cashmere Bengal. Since 2017 The International Cat Association (TICA) has accepted the Bengal Longhair in competitions.

              The <strong>Birman</strong> also called the "Sacred Cat of Burma", is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white "gloves" on each paw.

            <p>
              The breed name is derived from Birmanie, the French form of Burma. The Birman breed was first recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1967. It is also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and the International Cat Association (TICA) in 1979.</p>
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              No clear record of the breed's origin exists. They are most often claimed to have originated as the companions of temple priests in northern Burma in the Mount of Lugh. Many stories exist of how the cats first came to France, including pairs of cats being given as a reward for helping defend a temple, or being smuggled out of Burma and Sweden by a Vanderbilt. Another pair of Birmans (or a pregnant female called Poupée de Maldapour) were said to have been stolen and later imported to France by Thadde Haddisch. The first traces of historical Birmans go back to a Mme Leotardi in Nice, France.           
              </p>
              <p>
                Many believe, as legend will tell, that the breed originated in Burma (now known as Myanmar) among the temples of ancient times and alongside priests; however, there are also some that later believed the felines came to Europe, namely France, from somewhere in Asia, which has been spread from other legends and stories passed around as well. Regardless of the numerous stories and folklore that go around, there is a positivity that the Birman cat breed was found in France as early as the 1920s, and many different stories continue to surface about the mystique that lies behind their history.
              </p>
<p>
  Birmans were almost wiped out as a breed during World War II. Only two cats were alive in Europe at the end of the war, a pair named Orloff and Xenia de Kaabaa, both belonging to Baudoin-Crevoisier. The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966.

              The first Birman cats were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using blue Persian lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points. Birmans have also been used in the development of new breeds such as the Ragdoll.
            </p>

            <p>
              Birmans have a medium-sized, rectangular body with a broad face and distinct Roman nose. Their ears are ideally as wide on the base as they are tall and should be set as much on top of the head as on the side. The eyes are rounded and should be a deep sapphire blue.

              The Birman's fur is medium-long and should have a silky texture. Unlike a Persian or Himalayan, they have no undercoat, thus are much less prone to matting. Coat colour is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white, symmetrical "gloves" on each paw that are the trademark of the breed. The white must involve all toes and in front must stop at the articulation or at the transition of toes to metacarpals. These gloves should extend noticeably further up the back of the leg (referred to as the "laces"), finishing with an inverted V extended half to three-fourths up the hock. Any other spot of white on the points is considered a serious fault. The base body colour is white to cream, with a wash of colour that corresponds to the points, but is much paler.
              
              Recognized point colours are seal, chocolate, red and the corresponding dilute varieties: blue, lilac and cream. Tabby and tortie variations in seal, chocolate, blue or lilac are also allowed; other colours are in development.           
             </p>
             <p>
              Like all colour-point breeds, Birman kittens are born white and begin developing their points after one week if a dark colour (i.e. seal point) and 14 days or more if the points are "clear" or lighter-coloured (i.e. lilac point). Their coats do not reach full development up until the cats are two years old.
             </p>

            <h3>Genetic diversity</h3>
            <p>
              The 2008 study "The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations" by Lipinski et al. found that the Birman has one of the lowest levels of genetic diversity of all the breeds studied.            
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3> 
            <p>
              The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats. In Birman cats, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolisation originating in the heart, and sudden death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paltrinieri, Giraldi, Prolo, Scarpa, et al. (2017) found that Birman cats have a high serum concentration of creatinine and symmetric dimethylarginine, but most Birman cats have higher concentrations of creatinine than SDMA. Creatinine is a creatine phosphate and is produced during metabolism of creatine, and is excreted through urination. SDMA is a methylated form of the amino acid arginine and is released during normal catabolisms of body proteins. Levels of creatinine and SDMA are found when Birman cats are tested for chronic kidney disease, for which they are at high risk. Birman cats are also at risk of developing feline infectious peritonitis; a disease that alters the renal function (creatinine levels in blood and urine) in the cats. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Birman was over-represented with an odds ratio of 6.77.
            </p>
            <h3>Birman naming convection</h3>
            <p>
              Many Birman breeders follow the French tradition of assigning all kittens born in a particular year given names that begin with the same letter of the alphabet. Countries with breeders using this convention include Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Kittens born in 2016 would start with 'N', and in 2017 'O', and so on.

              The <strong>Bombay</strong> is a short-haired breed of domestic cat. Bombays are glossy solid black cats with a muscular build, and have characteristic large bright copper-golden eyes. The breed is named after the Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai), referring to the habitat of the Indian black leopard.
            </p>
            <p>
              There exist two different variants of Bombay breed; the American Bombay and the British Bombay, which are both referred to as just Bombay. American-type Bombays were developed by crossbreeding sable American Burmese and black American Shorthair cats, to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat with copper-golden eyes. British-type Bombays are solid black-coloured Asian Self cats under the Asian group, a group of European Burmese and chinchilla Persian crosses. The British-type Bombay originated from three mismatings of European Burmese with black domestic short-haired cats.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was developed by Nikki Horner, a breeder from Louisville, Kentucky, who, starting in 1958, attempted to create a breed of cat that resembled a miniature black panther. The first attempt was a failure, but the second, in 1965, was successful. The breed was officially recognised and registered by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1970 and The International Cat Association in 1979
                         </p>

            <p>
              The Bombay is described as the “patent leather kid with the new penny eyes.” The Bombay is a short-haired breed of domestic cat, closely related to the Burmese. Bombay cats are characterised as having an all-black coat, including the whiskers, and black skin, including the soles, nose leather and mouth. The close-lying, sleek and glossy black coat is of mature cats is coloured to the roots with no paling (exceptions are allowed in juvenile cats less than 2 years old). The eyes are always copper-golden coloured, and green eyes are not allowed.   
                     </p>
            <p>
              The Bombay has a medium-sized, Oriental-type body build that is muscular. Their weight ranges between 2.5-5 kg (5.5-11.0 lb), with males typically being heavier than females.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Body </strong>: Medium size, graceful and elongated Oriental-type body. Elegant tail of medium length.            
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Head</strong> : Rounded heads with no sharp angles, and short. The shape is smooth. The muzzle is short, with a moderate nose “stop” which is visible (not a break). The medium-sized ears are wide-set, straight, and rounded at the tips. The large, round eyes are set far apart and are always copper-coloured, but can range from bright orange to warm golden. Green eyes are not allowed.
            </p> 
            <p>
              <strong>Coat</strong>: Short, dense and shiny, tight to the body, with a lacquered sheen. Only completely solid black coloured coats are allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Weight</strong>: For females, the average is 6 to 8 pounds. For males, the average is 8 to 10 pounds.

              Health
            </h3>
            <p>
              A healthy Bombay has an average lifespan of 15 years, and some have been known to live up to 20. They can have some nasal and sinus problems, and gingivitis. Their food intake should be controlled to avoid overfeeding.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Temperament
            </h3>
              <p>
                The personality of the Bombay tends to be highly social, is marked by strong attachment to families, and is typified by craving attention. As a breed, they are therefore highly suitable for children.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bombay cats are happy and comfortable being strictly indoor cats, and can comfortably live in a single room apartment, so long as all of their needs are met. They prefer quiet surroundings.

              The <strong>Brazilian Shorthair</strong> is a breed of cat. It is the first cat breed from Brazil to receive international recognition.
            </p>
           
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              The Brazilian Shorthair is a medium-sized cat of great agility. The breed can be distinguished from the American Shorthair by its sleek and elegant appearance, though cats of the breed are not as thin as the Siamese. The coat is short and close to the skin and comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The space between the eyes should be equal to the size of one eye. Brazilian Shorthairs have dramatically expressive eyes. They are longer than they are tall. Males have bigger heads than females.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Brazilian Shorthair Cat had its beginning when the engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi, a cat breeder and founder of the first Cat Federation in Brazil and the first Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro, had the idea to transform certain cats found in the streets of Brazil into a purebred cat. He focused on the Iberian Peninsula cats, brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in their ships around 1500 A.D. From North to South of Brazil, commissions were created by Dr. Paulo Ruschi to study this animal in all of the country's parks and streets. After long years of experimental breeding program led by traditional breeders, the Brazilian Shorthair was finally approved by the World Cat Federation, with headquarters in Germany, as a Pure Breed cat. Nowadays, the Brazilian Shorthair cat can participate in contests all over the world.
                         </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>

            <p>
              They have medium-sized and muscular bodies. The tail should not be broad at the base, and should slightly taper in the tip. Brazilian Shorthair cats have a slightly curved profile and large, pointed ears, and large, rounded eyes with colour that resembles the coat's colour. The coat is very short, silky and glossy and with no undercoat. Minimal brushing is required. Almost all colours are possible.            </p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              The Brazilian Shorthair is viable as an indoor as well as an outdoor cat, and is keen on human contact. They are very playful as a kitten. As they get older, they sober up a little, though they stay fairly active.

            </p>
            <h3>
              Origin
            </h3>
            <p>
              The breed was purportedly started by a cat breeder named Paulo Samuel Ruschi, who founded the first Cat Federation in Brazil and the first Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro. Paulo Ruschi started this effort in 1985. Ruschi noticed that feral and street cats from multiple cities in Brazil shared a good number of common characteristics, and decided to look into this further.  Ruschi's research apparently traced these cats' origins back to the late 15th century early 16th century, to cats brought over on ships by Portuguese colonizers and merchants.
            </p>  
            <p>
              His theory then proposes that these cats brought from Portugal descended from cats from the Iberian Peninsula. Therefore, the Brazilian Shorthair's ancestors are from the Iberian Peninsula.  These Portuguese cats, once in Brazil, settled and then began adapting to their new climate conditions, leading to the creation of a landrace population
            </p>  
            <p>
              The claim here is that, like how cats brought from Europe to North America evolved to develop some differences (from which two landrace/natural breeds were developed - the Maine Coon and American Shorthair), European moggies brought to South America also diverged over time.  Supposedly, South American cats are generally lighter and skinnier than their ancestors (their main comparison being with the European shorthair). This is plausible, since cats in warmer areas tend to have more slender body types. Street and feral cats from Brazil are claimed to be a distinct landrace within the South American cat population, similar to the Maine Coon within the North American cat population.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ruschi himself notes that Brazilian shorthairs are different from cats in Europe, though he doesn't seem to have research to back this up, only his personal account that when visiting Europe (can't seem to find a specification of what area), the street cats there were larger, more robust, had wider heads, and shorter muzzles. 
            </p>
            <h3>
              History
            </h3>
            <p>
              The breed had developed without rules or special cares; until, in the 1980s, Brazilian-born engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi, a cat breeder currently living in New York City, started to settle the rules for the breed after deciding to study genetic and morphological aspects of the cats running in parks, gardens and streets of several cities in Brazil. He noticed that the country had unique cats, and yet, that those street cats had the same appearance and features. Those are the characteristics that define the Brazilian Shorthair cat. In 1998 the World Cat Federation, the largest Cat Federation in the world, gave a status of "approved breed" to the first and only Brazilian Recognized Purebred Cat, now with more than 10 generations of pedigreed cats.

              " class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
              The <strong>British Longhair</strong> is a medium-sized, semi-long-haired breed of domestic cat, originating in Great Britain.
            </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>
              The British Longhair is a longer-haired development from the longstanding British Shorthair breed. In the mid-20th century, British Shorthairs were interbred with imported long-haired varieties, like the Turkish Angora and what today is called the Traditional Persian, with an aim to producing more stout and round-faced stock, while retaining the short coat. As a result of this hybridization, British catteries have frequently produced (generally unwanted) semi-long-haired offspring among their litters. In more recent years, these have been intentionally bred (often outside the UK) to each other and sometimes to standard British Shorthairs, to establish a consistent, formalized British Longhair breed.            
            </p>

            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              The breed is in the first stages of recognition with the two major cat fancy organizations in the UK, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy and Felis Britannica (the UK branch of Fédération Internationale Féline). The naming of the breed, and whether it is treated as a distinct breed, is quite inconsistent between the few pedigree registry organisations that acknowledge it as of 2015. It is called the British Longhair, British Longhair Variant, British Semi-Longhair, and Longhair British. It is sometimes known as the Britannica in some European countries, and also the Lowlander in the United States.            </p>
             <p>
              Feline Federation Europe (FFE) calls them (in the same breed standard), the British Longhair Variant, the Highlander, and the Highland Straight. However, the latter two of those names have already been used by other registries to refer to completely different cats. The Highlander (with a variant, the Highlander Shorthair) is actually a development from the American Curl, and not closely related to the British breeds; it is a very large cat, with close-set, often upward-curling ears. The Highland Straight, a British breed, is actually the straight-eared variant of the Highland Fold; together, they are the longer-haired versions of the Scottish Straight and Scottish Fold, respectively. (TICA uses different terminology: Scottish Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Scottish Straight and Scottish Straight Longhair, to avoid confusion with the Highlander.)
             </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              British Longhairs can be prone to obesity if neutered or kept as indoor-only cats.

Like most longer-haired cats, they require brushing or are prone to matting. Autumn and winter are the seasons when they have the highest risk of tangles because their coat thickens in preparation for winter.

The breed - like others derived from and including the Persian - have increased risk of inherited polycystic kidney disease (PKD), especially autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). In this disease, multiple fluid-filled sacs develop within the kidney tissue. The kidneys' ability to function is severely hampered by these cysts. To protect kittens from this disease, breeders often do a DNA test to identify the disease in the parents.

              The <strong>British Shorthair</strong> is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. In modern times, it remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Researchers are not sure how cats first reached the British Isles. In many other parts of Europe cats became common at the same time as the spread of the Roman Empire, however it appears that housecats reached the British Isles before the Romans did.
            </p>
            <p>
              These cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands. Based on artists' representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selective breeding of the best examples of the type began in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-grey variant called the "British Blue" or "English type" (to distinguish it from the more fine-boned "Russian type"). Some sources directly credit UK artist, and pioneering cat fancier, Harrison Weir with the initial concept of standardising the breed. Others suggest a group of breeders may have been involved. The new British Shorthair was featured at the first-ever cat show, organised by Weir and held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871, and enjoyed great initial popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the 1900s with the advent of the newly imported Persian and other long-haired breeds, the British Shorthair had fallen out of favour, and breeding stock had become critically rare by World War I. At least partially to alleviate this, British Shorthair breeders mixed Persians into their bloodlines. The genes thus introduced would eventually become the basis for the British Longhair. At the time, any long-haired cats produced were placed into the Persian breeding program. As all cats with the blue colouration were then judged together as variants on a de facto single breed. The Blue Shorthair, outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the war, in an attempt to maintain the breed standard, the GCCF decided to accept only third-generation Persian/British Shorthair crosses. This contributed to another shortage of pure breeding stock by World War II, at which point the Persian and Russian Blue were reintroduced into the mix. British Shorthair breeders also worked with the French Chartreux, another ancient breed, which although genetically unrelated to the British Blue, is a very similar cat in appearance. Breeders worked to re-establish the true British type, and by the late 1970s, the distinctive British Shorthair had achieved formal recognition from both the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA). According to the GCCF's 2013 registry data, it is once again the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country.

            <p>
              The British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking large cat, having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep copper orange in the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set
                        </p>
            <p>
              The British Blue variant can often be confused with the grey Scottish Fold, a breed closely related to the British Shorthair. However, the Shorthair can be characterised by having its pointy triangular ears, whereas the Fold has softer, folded ears.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are slow to mature in comparison with most cat breeds, reaching full physical development at approximately three years of age. Unusually among domestic cats they are a noticeably sexually dimorphic breed, with males averaging 9-17 lb (4.1-7.7 kg) and females 7-12 lb (3.2-5.4 kg).
            </p>
            <h3>Coat, colour, and patterns</h3>
            <p>
              The British Shorthair's coat is one of the breed's defining features. It is very dense, but does not have an undercoat; thus, the texture is plush rather than woolly or fluffy, with a firm, "crisp" pile that breaks noticeably over the cat's body as it moves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the British Blue remains the most familiar variant, British Shorthairs have been developed in many other colours and patterns. Black, blue, white, red, cream, silver, golden and—most recently—cinnamon and fawn are accepted by all official standards, either solid or in colourpoint, tabby, shaded and bicolour patterns; the GCCF, FIFe and TICA also accept chocolate and its dilute lilac, disallowed in the CFA standard. All colours and patterns also have tortoiseshell variants.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tabby patterns include: Classic Tabby, Mackerel Tabby, Spotted & Ticked Tabby. The non-tabby patterns include: Tortoiseshell, Bi-Colour, Van patterns Bi-Colour & White, Smoke, Tipped & Colourpointed.

British Shorthair's nose colour: black, cherry red, brick red; a circle of black nasal line on the periphery.

            <p>
              British Shorthairs are an easygoing and dignified breed, not as active and playful as many, but sweet-natured and devoted to their owners, making them a favorite of animal trainers. They tend to be safe around other pets and children since they will tolerate a fair amount of physical interaction, but as a rule do not like to be picked up or carried. They require only minimal grooming and take well to being kept as indoor-only cats; however, they can be prone to obesity unless care is taken with their diet.
            </p>
              <p>
                British Shorthairs are quiet and vigilant, but if they trust their owners, they will silently follow their activities and stay with them. British Shorthair cats are not lap cats. They are more accustomed to staying beside people than squatting on people's laps. Similarly, they prefer the feeling of having their feet on the ground. They have a low voice and a moderate activity level. When no one is at home, they will stay at home quietly and wait for their owners to return.
            </p>
            <h3>Cat shows</h3>

            <p>
              First introduced to Britain by the Romans, the British shorthair was one of the domestic cat breeds originally bred for its hunting prowess. In the last 150 years, the breed pivoted towards being bred for physical qualities. The British Shorthair breed debut --- along with a wide range of other selectively bred felines --- in the first organized cat show arranged by Harrison Weir at London's Crystal Palace in 1871. Ever since their debut, British shorthairs maintained the premiere pedigree at cat shows, up until 1895.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortly after the British Shorthair exhibit in the Crystal Palace show, the popularity of British Shorthair increased. The public began searching for breeders of British Shorthairs with various character and color traits, all in the pursuit of "exoticness". From the late 1800's up to the early 1910's, certain British Shorthairs would occasionally earn notoriety, or decorated titles in Cat Competitions. The British Shorthair publicity from 19th and 20th century cat shows helped British Shorthairs become one of the most popular pet cat breeds today. For example, in the 1980's, the British Shorthair was featured in competition by the CFA, or Cat Fancier's Association, which led to an increase in demand for British Shorthairs as household pets. As of 2023, the British Shorthair ranks the 6th most popular cat breed in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of 2015, the TICA cat show competition standards for British Shorthairs judge the cats for their circular head shape, muzzle, and cheeks. Small to medium ears are desired, with large, round, leveled eyes. Eye shape is more important than color. The muzzle and chin shape should complement the circular face; the profile and nose should be short, further complementing the circular face. The neck should give the illusion of the cat having no neck, blending in with the cheeks. The body of the cat should have a sturdy and muscular torso, complemented by medium to short legs, finished with round medium to large feet. The tail of the cat should be thick at the base, and tapers to a rounded tip, totaling about two thirds of the body's length. Internally, the cat should have substantial boning, and a firm and sturdy musculature. As for the cat's coat, no preference on color is stated, rather the coat should be straight, dense, and even in length.

            <p>
              The UK breed committee considers the British Shorthair a long-lived cat, with a life expectancy of 14-20 years. Vet clinic data from England shows a median lifespan of 11.8 years. Swedish insurance data puts the median lifespan of the breed at > 12.5 years. 82% of British Shorthairs lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be a problem in the breed. A Danish prevalence study with more than 329 cats showed that 20.4% of males and 2.1% of the females had HCM. On top of this 6.4% of males and 3.5% of females were judged to be equivocal. HCM testing of males used for breeding is now mandatory for breeders organised under the Danish Fife member, Felis Danica.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed is thought to be at high risk of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A DNA test lab has noted a significant decrease of the PKD mutations in tested populations. Carrier frequency is now at 1%.
            </p>
            <h3>Polycystic kidney disease</h3>
            <p>
              his disease forms a cyst in the cat's kidney, causing organ failure. Polycystic kidney disease can be detected through genetic testing or ultrasound. There is no cure for polycystic kidney disease but there are drugs that can alleviate the effects and its advancement.
            </p>
            <h3>Cardiomyopathy</h3>

            <p>
              The heart muscle thickens which limits the amount of blood that is pumped, leading to blood clots and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be detected through ultrasound, ECG, and x-ray. Drugs can alleviate and slow down the advancement of the disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              And urinary tract diseases are very common.
            </p>
            <h3>Hyperthyroidism</h3>
            <p>
              Some British Shorthairs have hyperthyroidism, which is caused by excessive thyroid hormone production, affecting metabolism. It brings serious problems to cats because thyroid hormone affects nearly all of cats' organs, especially their hearts. Older cats, in general, are more susceptible to it. Some of the signs are weight loss, panting, sickness, and greasy coat. Cats with hyperthyroidism need surgery and medication as treatment.
            </p>
            <h3>Cystitis</h3>
            <p>
              Cystitis affects cats' urinary tracts and leads to inflammation in their urinary bladders. Cystitis is hard to cure. Stress, bacterial infection, and bladder stones usually cause cystitis. Some of the symptoms are frequent urination and having blood in cats' urine. Cats with cystitis need plenty of water and special medical diet. The treatments include anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics.

              The <strong>Burmese</strong> cat (Burmese: ဗမာကြောင်, Băma kyaung, Thai: ทองแดง or ศุภลักษณ์, RTGS: Thongdaeng or Supphalak, meaning copper colour) is a breed of domestic cat, originating in Burma, believed to have its roots near the Thai-Burma border and developed in the United States and Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most modern Burmese are descendants of one female cat called Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma to the United States in 1930 and bred with American Siamese. From there, American and British breeders developed distinctly different Burmese breed standards, which is unusual among pedigreed domestic cats. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognise the two as separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally, all Burmese cats were dark brown (genetically black), but are now available in a wide variety of colours; formal recognition of these also varies by standard. Both versions of the breed are known for their uniquely social and playful temperament and persistent vocalisation.

            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In 1871, Harrison Weir organised a cat show at the Crystal Palace, London. A pair of Siamese cats were on display that closely resembled modern American Burmese cats in build, thus probably similar to the modern Tonkinese breed. The first attempt to deliberately develop the Burmese in the late 19th century in Britain resulted in what were known as Chocolate Siamese rather than a breed in their own right; this view persisted for many years, encouraging crossbreeding between Burmese and Siamese in an attempt to more closely conform to the Siamese build. The breed thus slowly died out in Britain.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Joseph Cheesman Thompson imported Wong Mau, a black female cat, into San Francisco in 1930. Thompson considered the cat's build to be sufficiently different from the Siamese to still have potential as a fully separate breed. Wong Mau was bred with Tai Mau, a seal point Siamese, and then bred with her son to produce dark brown kittens that became the foundation of a new, distinctive strain of Burmese. In 1936, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) granted the breed formal recognition. However, due to continued extensive outcrossing with Siamese cats to increase the population, the original type was overwhelmed, and the CFA suspended breed recognition a decade later.[2] Attempts by various American breeders to refine the unique Burmese standard persisted, however, and in 1954, the CFA lifted the suspension permanently. In 1958, the United Burmese Cat Fanciers (UBCF) compiled an American judging standard that has remained essentially unchanged since its adoption.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712007887/1312/Cats/Burmese/Geisha_One_Year_Old__5640618397_cbk9vf.jpg" alt="Burmese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Meanwhile, in the UK, interest in the breed was reviving. The cats that composed the new British breeding program were of a variety of builds, including some imported from the United States. By 1952, three true generations had been produced in Britain and the breed was recognised by the United Kingdom's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Since the 1950s, countries in the Commonwealth and Europe started importing British Burmese; as a result, most countries have based their standard on the British model.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, the two versions of the breed were kept strictly distinct genetically. European Burmese (also known as "traditional") were declassed as a breed by the CFA in the 1980s. The GCCF banned the registration of all Burmese imported from the United States in order to preserve the "traditional" bloodlines. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognise these dual standards as representing separate breeds, but those that do refer to the British type as the European Burmese. Recently, The International Cat Association (TICA) and CFA clubs have started using the American breed standard at select shows in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the early period of breed development, it became clear that Wong Mau herself was genetically a crossbreed between a Siamese and Burmese type. This early crossbreed type was later developed as a separate breed, known today as the Tonkinese. Burmese cats have also been instrumental in the development of the Bombay and the Burmilla, among others.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712007883/1312/Cats/Burmese/British_burmese_-_Andel_Alois_at_Cat_show_z561jo.jpg" alt="Burmese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The two standards differ mainly in head and body shape. The British or traditional ideal tends toward a more slender, long-bodied cat with a wedge-shaped head, large pointed ears, long tapering muzzle and moderately almond-shaped eyes. The legs should likewise be long, with neat oval paws. The tail tapers to medium length. The American (also called "contemporary") Burmese is a noticeably stockier cat, with a much broader head, round eyes and distinctively shorter, flattened muzzle; the ears are wider at the base. Legs and tail should be proportionate to the body, medium-length, and the paws also rounded.

            </p>
            <p>
              In either case, Burmese are a small to medium size breed, tending to be about 4-6 kg (9-13 lb), but are nevertheless substantially-built, muscular cats and should feel heavy for their size when held - "a brick wrapped in silk".
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712007888/1312/Cats/Burmese/%D0%A8%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%82_bmxjum.jpg" alt="Burmese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <h3>Coat and colour</h3>
            <p>
              In either standard, the coat should be very short, fine and glossy, with a satin-like finish. Colour is solid and must be uniform over the body, only gradually shading to lighter underparts. Faint colourpoint markings may be visible, but any barring or spotting is considered a serious fault.[1] The eyes are green or gold depending on coat colour.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed's original standard colour is a distinctively rich dark brown (genetically black), variously known as sable (USA), brown (UK, Australia) or seal (New Zealand). It is the result of the Burmese gene (cb), part of the albino series. This gene causes a reduction in the amount of pigment produced, converting black into brown and rendering all other colours likewise paler than their usual expression.[7] The action of the gene also produces the modified colourpoint effect, which is more noticeable in young kittens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first blue Burmese was born in 1955 in Britain, followed by red, cream, and tortoiseshell over the next decades. Chocolate ("champagne" in the USA) first appeared in the United States. Lilac ("platinum" in the USA), the last major variant to appear, was likewise developed in the USA beginning in 1971. Currently, the British GCCF standard recognises solid black ("brown" in the UK), chocolate, blue, lilac, red and cream, as well as the tortoiseshell pattern on a base of black, chocolate, blue or lilac.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the USA, chocolate ("champagne"), blue, and lilac ("platinum") cats were first formally considered a separate breed, the Malayan, in 1979. This distinction was abolished in 1984, but until 2010, the CFA continued to place the black ("sable") Burmese into a separate division, bundling all other recognised colours into a "dilute division" and judging them separately.[8] Currently, the CFA standard still recognises the Burmese only in solid black ("sable"), blue, chocolate ("champagne"), and lilac ("platinum").
            </p>
            <p>
              Other colours have been developed from this initial base set, with varying degrees of popularity and recognition. In 1989 a cinnamon breeding programme was started in the Netherlands; the first fawn kitten was born in 1998. Cinnamon, fawn, caramel, and apricot Burmese have also been developed in New Zealand, as have tortoiseshell variants of all these colours.[10][11] A new colour mutation ("russet") appeared in New Zealand in 2007. This line has an initially dark pigment in the cats' coats, which fades as they grow, eventually becoming a paler orange colour.
            </p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              Burmese are a notably people-oriented breed, maintaining their kitten-like energy and playfulness into adulthood. They are also said to have a number of overtly puppy-like characteristics, forming strong bonds with their owners and gravitating toward human activity. The cats often learn to play games such as 'fetch' and 'tag'.[9] Veterinarian Joan O. Joshua has written that the "dog-like attachment to the owners" of the Burmese, as with the similarly behaving Abyssinians, causes "greater dependence on human contacts". This stands in contrast to the mere "tolerant acceptance of human company" based around "comforts" that other breeds display.[13] They are persistently vocal, in a manner reminiscent of their Siamese ancestry, yet they have softer, sweeter voices. Burmese are not as independent as other breeds and are not suited to being left alone for extended periods of time.

            <h3>Genetics</h3>
            <p>
              The Burmese gene is also present in some other cat breeds, particularly the established rex breeds, where it can be fully expressed in its homozygous form (cbcb) (referred to as Burmese Colour Restriction or Sepia). The same gene can also be combined with the Siamese gene (cbcs) to produce either darker points or a light-on-dark-brown coat, similar to the Burmese chocolate (champagne in the USA), known as "mink".
            </p>
            <p>
              The Asian Group cat breed is related to the Burmese; the Asian is physically similar but comes in different patterns and colours. The Singapura is always homozygous for the Burmese gene, combining it with a ticked tabby pattern. Snow Bengals with eye colours other than blue also have the gene.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lineage of Burmese cats known as "Contemporary Burmese" often hosts a 4-aminoacid deletion on the ALX1 gene. Heterozygosity of the mutation results in brachicephaly, while homozygosity results in a profound head malformation known as the Burmese head defect, usually incompatible with life.

              A 2008 study conducted at UC Davis by the team led by feline geneticist Dr Leslie Lyons found that the American Burmese has the second lowest level of genetic diversity (after the Singapura) of all the breeds studied, and concludes that this situation should be addressed.[20] The CFA observes that "breeders are reporting less hearty litters, smaller adults, smaller litters, and immune system problems, all of which point towards inbreeding depression becoming more common." The Burmese breed council currently allows outcrossing using Bombay, Tonkinese and Burmese type cats imported from Southeast Asia to improve genetic diversity.[21] The Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) excludes novice show cats from breeding.

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              A study in England of veterinary records found the Burmese to have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus compared to other breeds with 2.27% of Burmese having the condition compared to the overall rate of 0.58%.[23] An Australian study found a prevalence of 22.1% compared to an overall rate of 7.4%.
            </p>
            <p>
              A study of veterinary records in England found an average life expectancy of 14.3.

            <p>
              Certain UK bloodlines suffer from an acute teething disorder in young kittens (FOPS: Feline Orofacial Pain Syndrome), where the eruption of the second teeth causes extreme discomfort and the young cat tears at its face to try to alleviate the pain. Eruption of the new teeth in the jaw that causes the problem; these cannot be removed until they have erupted, by which time the problem ceases. Pain relief intervention should be considered, to prevent overt self-trauma. Apart from scarring caused by the self-mutilation, the cat seems to recover completely.

              The <strong>Tiffanie</strong>  (a portmanteau of Burm-ese and Chinch-illa ) is a breed of domestic cat, that originated in the United Kingdom in 1981. It is a cross between the Chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. In certain cat registries the breed falls under the Asian group, and is sometimes referred to as the Asian Shaded. Standards were produced in 1984, and the breed gained championship status in the United Kingdom in the 1990s.
            </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708094480/1312/Cats/Burmilla/Male_Burmilla_cat_c3hh5j.jpg" alt="Burmilla" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The Burmilla was accidentally born in the cattery of Miranda von Kirchberg in the United Kingdom. Two cats, a chinchilla Persian kitten, called Jamari Sanquist, and a lilac Burmese, called Bambino Lilac Fabergé, were both awaiting a partner in different rooms. One night, the cleaner left the door open. The two cats mated, producing four kittens born in 1981; also birthing a new breed.
            </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>

            <p>
              In GCCF (Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), the Burmilla is considered part of the Asian group. It is accepted in FIFe as the Burmilla. Only the silver shaded and tipped varieties have been recognised in GCCF, FIFe, CCCA, ACF and CFA. As of late 2011, additionally golden shaded and tipped Burmillas are recognised within FIFe. The ACF also recognises golden shaded and tipped.

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              The Burmilla is an irreverent and independent cat who adores its owner and displays many kitten-like characteristics, even into adulthood. In temperament they are sociable, playful and affectionate and get along well with children and other animals.

              The <strong>California Spangled </strong>  is a breed of domestic cat that was bred to resemble spotted wild cats, like the ocelot and leopard. The popularity of two other spotted cats breeds, the Ocicat and the Bengal, overshadowed their development. 
             </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the poaching death of a leopard, the anthropologist Louis Leakey motivated Paul Arnold Casey, Jr. of California to breed a domestic cat resembling a small leopard in order to emphasize how important it was to preserve the leopard.            </p>
            <p>
              California Spangled cats are a crossbreed of many strains, including the Abyssinian, American Shorthair and British Shorthair. Despite their wild appearance, they are completely domestic.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Originally bred by Paul Arnold Casey, Jr., a Hollywood scriptwriter, playwright, and author, after his return from Tanzania while working with Louis Leakey in the 1970s. Casey's novel, "Open The Coffin" chronicles his journey in Africa and subsequent breeding that led to the California Spangle.
             </p>
             <p>
              This animal was ideally bred to resemble a leopard, thus giving the impression of a "House-Leopard". One of many motivations for this breed was that people would not want to wear the same type of fur that resembled their pet.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Spangle was introduced to the general public on the cover of the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog in 1986.
             </p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              This cat gives the initial impression of being a miniature leopard. It has a long, lean, somewhat muscular body and a low slung walk, along with spots. The most desired shape of spots on the cats is round, yet somewhat blockish. Triangular, oval, or square spots are acceptable also. The Spangle's coat may be any of the following colors: bronze, gold, blue, brown, charcoal, red, black, silver, or white. They have conspicuous cheekbones and light, large whisker pads. Spangles may look wild, but are purely domestic and adore playing and interacting with their people.
            </p>

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
              California Spangled Cats are said to be affectionate, social, curious, and extremely devoted to their owners. They are big on eye contact and being in on the action; they love to perch on places that are at shoulder or eye level so that they can see exactly what is going on. They are known for their well-honed intelligence, athletic abilities, high energy level, and accidental acrobatics. California Spangled Cats love to pounce and have very sharp hunting skills, they also enjoy games that involve a large participation part by their owner.

              The <strong>Chantilly-Tiffany</strong> also known as the Chantilly or the Foreign Longhair, was a breed of domestic cat which originated in the late-1960s in North America. The Chantilly breed never got off the ground and has always been rare. It was near-extinction in the late-1980s and again in the late-2000s. Since 2015 the breed is considered extinct with the passing and neutering of the last two cats of Chantilly lineage, and with no intact Chantilly cats the inevitable resulting discontinuation of the breeding program.
             </p>
            <p>
              The Chantilly-Tiffany is often confused with the unrelated Tiffanie, or Asian/Burmilla longhair, a semi-longhaired breed originating in the UK. Similarly, a variety of that breed, the Australian Tiffanie, can cause confusion. Furthermore, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) is sometimes confused with the Chantilly-Tiffany, but refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>New York, US (1960s-1970s)</p>
            <p>
              The Chantilly-Tiffany breed had its official beginning as a "Foreign Longhair"; in 1967, Jennie Robinson (Neotype Cattery) of New York purchased a pair of semi-foreign longhaired chocolate cats with golden eyes of unknown background as part of an estate sale in White Plains, New York. They may have had the same parents but were not litter-mates. "Thomas" was about a year of age upon purchase, and "Shirley" was around six months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shirley's first litter of six kittens was born in May 1969. All kittens had a chocolate coat colour and shared a similar appearance. Robinson initiated a breeding program to emphasise these traits. In the early 1970s, the ACA registered Thomas and Shirley, along with many of their descendants as "Foreign-Longhairs".
            </p>
            <p>United States (1970s-1980s)</p>
            <p>
              Robinson ended her breeding program in the 1970s. Sigyn Lund (Sig Tim Hil Cattery) a Florida Burmese breeder, purchased some of Robinson's kittens and took on the "Foreign Longhair" breeding program. The New York origin was not well known to the public at the time. Because of Lund's reputation as a Burmese breeder, it has been speculated that the Chantilly was a long haired Burmese or related to the breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Robinson herself confirmed about the kittens born in May 1969 that these “were dark self-colours with no points and pinkish paw pads, the opposite of traits that identify Burmese.” She also confirmed that all the Chantillys in the US descended from Thomas and Shirley, and none were bred to Burmese cats. Similarly, Tracy Oraas a major advocate of the Chantilly breed in the 1980-1990s, confirmed that the Burmese was never used in the breeding program. This hypothesis has now been discounted.
            </p>
            <p>
              A change in the breed's name was requested by judges, because they felt the breed's current name "Foreign Longhair" was too general; the name "Mahogany" was suggested, but Lund changed the breed-name from "Foreign-Longhair" to "Tiffany" for the latter's feeling of elegance and class. Lund promoted the breed under "Tiffany" after a theater studio in Los Angeles in the 1920s known for its elegance. The ACA dropped the "Tiffany" from recognition, their reason being its rarity. As a result, all breed representatives registered under the Lund (Sig Tim Hil Cattery) name became unregistered and lost their pedigree status.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this event, the breed continued to be advertised as "Burmese". At one point, in an informal phone interview, Sig Tim Hil Cattery supplied information to researcher Joan Bernstein regarding these chocolate cats. This interview resulted in a publication of information, again suggesting the possibility they were the product of UK crosses between Burmese and Himalayans (a Persian/Siamese cross). This information was posted in Harper's Illustrated Handbook of Cats In The Ultimate Cat Book by David Taylor in 1989, the Chantilly's history was also described as "produced from crossing Burmese cats with Longhairs". The false advertisement and the phone interview could explain the tie to the Burmese in these books. The confusion led the breed to near-extinction.
            </p>
            <p>Canada (1970s-1980s)</p>
            <p>
              Around the same time Robinson and Lund were developing the "Tiffany" in the United States, a Canadian acreage owner was surprised by a cat who appeared at his home in 1973. She was a long-haired, semi-foreign, chocolate, gold-eyed feline of unknown ancestry who gave birth to a litter of kittens. Once again these kittens were carbon copies of their mother, an experience shared by Robinson with the cats in her breeding program. Offspring of these were rescued by Canadian breeders in order to re-establish the "Tiffany" breed in North America with a cooperative effort with Robinson and Lund.
            </p>
            <p>North America (1980s-1990s)</p>
            <p>
              One major advocate of the Chantilly was Tracy Oraas (Opurrtune Cattery) from Canada, who began her involvement with the breed in 1988 when she responded to a classified ad advertising "chocolate kittens." Oraas got in touch with Siamese Oriental breeder Jan DeRegt (Jan's PrettyCats Cattery) also from Canada, and Oraas and DeRegt undertook efforts to reestablish the breed after consulting a TICA judge. This judge expressed that nothing on the show bench compared with them. It took some major detective work, including calls to every veterinarian in Florida, but they managed to contact the Chantilly's original breeders, Robinson and Lund. Oraas and DeRegt also concluded that the Burmese breed was never used in any Chantilly breeding program. Their research did reveal that English breeders had crossed Foreign Longhair (Angora), Havana Brown and Abyssinian cats in an attempt to recreate an Angora-type cat. They suspect that the Chantilly may have been a product of these efforts. Since none of the original Chantillys could be found, they established the breed using registered European Angora, Havana Brown, Abyssinian/Somali and Nebelung cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1992, Oraas was asked to rename the breed because of possible confusion with the British Tiffanie  created in 1981. Wishing to preserve the elegance the "Tiffany" name represented, they chose "Chantilly." In 2000, TICA's Legal Council stated that breeders were only allowed to use the name Chantilly and were not allowed to use TICA and Chantilly/Tiffany together.
            </p>

            <p>
              Oraas bred "Chantilly/Tiffany" cats up to the early 2000s, then seems to have faded from the breeding scene. In 2001, there were a few catteries working with the Chantilly: one in Canada (Le Pors), and two in the United States; West Virginia (Emberhearth Cattery) and southern Illinois (Amorino Cattery).
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2003, Amorino Cattery of breeder Davenport-Parini was the only operating Chantilly cattery left in the US. Anne Davenport-Parini started Amorino Cattery in 2001 when she brought chocolate tabby Hershey Nugget (also known as Little Tabby Dude, LTD) of Emberhearth Cattery home to Illinois. Nugget was the grandson of Mica, a solid chocolate female Chantilly from Opurrtune Cattery of Tracy Oraas. Amorino Cattery had also acquired two female Chantilly cats; solid blue Cadeautje (Dutch: Little Present, which was also known as Katie, from Emberhearth Cattery) and solid lilac Nuage (from Opurrtune Cattery). Nugget produced at least 10 kittens with the two females before his retirement and passing in 2013 due to fatal long damage received during the 2012 fire.
            </p>
            <p>Extinction (2010s)
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012, a fire destroyed Amorino Cattery and its archives. With the fall of Amorino Cattery, the breed was facing extinction. The last Chantilly known in the US was solid chocolate Frosty (grandson of Nugget and Nuage). Frosty and Nugget appear together in the "Chantilly" episode of Cats 101, which was filmed at Amorino Cattery in 2012. Later that year after the fire, Frosty was shipped to a Nebelung breeder in Norway (Cacao Criadero Cattery). There was a struggle to get Frosty to breed to the Nebelung female (Nebelungs were permitted cross-outs). One solid lilac kitten, Acey, was produced in the efforts in 2013. In 2015, the Norwegian breeder gave up on the Chantilly breeding program after the death of Frosty, and fixed her female, Acey. As a result of this event, the last known Chantilly lineage ended, and the breed is considered extinct. There are no intact Chantilly cats alive and there are no operating Chantilly breeding programs.
            </p>



            <h3>Registration</h3>

            <p>
              The Chantilly was initially registered with ACA in the early 1970s as Foreign Longhair and later as Tiffany. However, with the lack of sufficient cats to form a breed, the recognition was reverted and the breed lost its pedigree status due to its rarity. When the breed was near-extinction in the late-1980s, breeder Tracy Oraas and Jan DeRegt revived the breed and registered it under the name Chantilly. Eventually, the Chantilly had been recognised and was eligible for championship or registration as Experimental or New Breed and colour (NBC) status with AACE, ACFA, CCA-AFC, CFF, TCA, TICA, and UFO.            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.
            </p>
             <p>
              In 2009, only a total of 15 Chantilly cats were ever registered in the Experimental Registry-category (VI) with TICA; 4 in 1992, 3 in 2000, 3 in 2002, and 5 in 2003.
             </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              Some sources claim Chantilly-Tiffanys were over-groomed. They tended to pull their own hair, which could lead to patches of baldness and the formation of digestive tract hairballs. To help prevent this, the cat should be brushed at least every other day to help control loose and shedding hair.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the contrary, according to the ACFA breed standard and Chantilly originator and breed advocate (J. Robinson and T. Oraas) the Chantilly was easily groomed due to its lack of undercoat and was little shedding.

              The <strong>Chartreux</strong> is a rare breed of cat from France, and is recognised by a number of registries around the world. The Chartreux is large and muscular (called cobby) with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and very fast reflexes. They are known for their blue (silver-grey) water-resistant short hair double coats which are often slightly thick in texture (often showing "breaks" like a sheepskin) and orange or copper-coloured eyes. Chartreux cats are also known for their "smile"; due to the structure of their heads and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling. Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are highly prized by farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for every French cat with a pedigree, the first letter of the official name of a Chartreux cat encodes the year of its birth. All Chartreux born in the same year have official names beginning with the same letter. The code letters rotate through the alphabet each year, omitting the letters K, Q, W, X, Y, and Z. For example, a Chartreux born in 2021 would have an official name starting with the letter S.            
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Chartreux is mentioned for the first time in 1558 by Joachim du Bellay in a poem entitled Vers Français sur la mort d'un petit chat, or "French verse on the death of a small cat" in English.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is another representation of a Chartreux in 1747 in the Jean-Baptiste Perronneau's painting Magdaleine Pinceloup de la Grange, into which the cat is painted as a pet, quite rare for the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from cats brought to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order's head monastery, the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of the city of Grenoble. But in 1972, the Prior of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery's archives held any records of the monks' use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legend also has it that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist Buffon in the 18th century. The breed was greatly diminished during the first World War and wild populations were not seen after World War II, except perhaps in Belle-Île-en-Mer where the Léger sisters started breeding the best subjects. A later concerted effort by European cat fanciers-breeders kept the Chartreux from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the U.S. in 1971 by Helen and John Gamon of La Jolla, California. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) advanced the Chartreux breed to championship status. There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America as of 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
              Historically, famous Chartreux owners include the French novelist Colette, Charles Baudelaire and the French president Charles de Gaulle.
            </p>
            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              Chartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as meowing or crying, and some are even completely mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good travelers and generally very healthy. Chartreux tend to bond with one person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.

              The <strong>Chausie</strong> (/'tʃaʊsi/) is a domestic breed of cat that was developed by breeding a few individuals from the non-domestic species jungle cat (Felis chaus) to a far greater number of domestic cats (Felis catus). The Chausie was first recognized as a domestic breed by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995. Within the domestic breeds, the Chausie is categorized as a non-domestic hybrid source breed. Because Chausies are mostly descended from domestic cats, by about the fourth generation they are fully fertile and completely domestic in temperament. 
            </p>
 
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The first hybrids of the jungle cat (Felis chaus) and the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) may have been born in Egypt several thousand years ago. The jungle cat is native to a vast region spanning Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. For the most part, it is an Asian species of wild cat that lives by rivers and lakes. But the species is found in one small area of North Africa: the Nile Delta. It is well known that the ancient Egyptians kept domestic cats as pets. Many domestic cat mummies have been found interred in Egyptian temples. What is not so well known is that one other species of cat was occasionally preserved after death via mummification; that was the jungle cat. F. chaus is not a timid species; they are known for moving into abandoned buildings and living as happily by irrigation canals as by wild rivers, provided that adequate prey and shrubbery for cover are available. Because domestic cats are likely to have frequently encountered jungle cats along the Nile and occasionally even within their owners' homes, it seems that hybrids of the two species were probably often born there.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few people experimented with breeding F. chaus to F. s. catus in the late 1960s and 1970s. Their intention was to provide a sensible alternative to keeping non-domestic cats as pets. However, the Chausie breed did not truly begin until the 1990s, when a dedicated group of breeders named the breed "Chausie" (after Felis chaus) and developed a planned breeding program and goals. These breeders asked for and received registration status from TICA in 1995. The breed worked its way through the New Breed Class from May 2001 through April 2013, and became TICA's newest Championship breed on May 1, 2013. Chausies are now being bred in both North America and Europe. The breed has begun the new breed recognition process in the World Cat Federation (WCF).
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708382781/1312/Cats/Chausie/ChausieBTT_ttzbhh.jpg" alt="Chausie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Currently, most authentic Chausies produced are late generation cats with fully domestic temperaments. Their TICA registration certificates will usually indicate that they are "C" generation or "SBT," which nearly always means they are four generations or more beyond the jungle cat (F. chaus). In cases where they are "A" or "B" generation, it is usually because they have been recently outcrossed to another domestic breed to improve specific cosmetic traits, but the cats are nonetheless more than four generations beyond the handful of nondomestic ancestors.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the official, permissible outcrosses for the Chausie breed during early breed development were the Abyssinian and the domestic shorthair (no recognizable breed), in practice any kind of purely domestic outcross could be used. TICA rules only dictated that cats must be a certain number of generations removed from the jungle cat ancestors and have three generations of registered Chausie ancestors to be eligible for competition at shows. Consequently, a variety of breeds, albeit usually lively outgoing breeds (see below), were used to develop the Chausie breed and continue to be used occasionally as outcrosses. This has given the breed a diverse and healthy genetic foundation.

            </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              Because breeders outcrossed the foundation jungle cats to mostly intelligent, outgoing breeds such as the Abyssinian and Oriental Shorthair, Chausies are intelligent, active, athletic cats. They are often very "busy" as kittens. As adults, they are quieter, but they still retain a playfulness and lifelong curiosity. Chausies do not like to be alone; they need to have other cats as companions or have human company most of the time. Chausies get along well with dogs, too, and will do fine if raised with a canine in the house. Additionally, Chausies form deep bonds with people. They are loyal, and may have difficulty adjusting if re-homed as adults.
            </p>
             <p>
              As with all non-domestic hybrid source breeds, some Chausies may inherit intestinal tracts similar to that of the non-domestic ancestors. The intestinal tract may be a little shorter than that of the traditional over elongated domestic cat's. A shorter intestinal tract is known to be incapable of processing ingredients derived from plants. That would include any kind of cereals, as well as vegetables, herbs, and spices. Those ingredients will serve as triggers for chronic intestinal inflammation and eventually lead to chronic inflammatory bowel disease that is perpetuated by multiple allergies to low quality, incomplete proteins in commercial cat food. Regardless of the cause, Chausies do seem somewhat prone to developing food allergies. To prevent this, breeders advise Chausie owners to feed only very high quality cat foods, containing as little of plant-derived ingredients as possible, or a homemade diet. If homemade diets are fed, it should be with the guidance of someone experienced in preparing them, because meat by itself does not contain all the nutrients that Chausies require.

              The <strong>Colorpoint Shorthair</strong>  is a variety of Siamese cat. The only major registries to recognise them are the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and the World Cat Federation (WCF). This breed was established from breeding American Shorthairs with the Siamese to produce different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors.
             </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707345319/1312/Cats/Colorpoint%20Shorthair/Young_male_flame_point_Siamese_vzme7j.jpg" alt="Colorpoint Shorthair" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Circa 1948 breeders in the US and UK wished to introduce new colorings into the Siamese — specifically red. The first Colorpoint Shorthair was bred from a red (ginger) tabby American Shorthair and a seal point Siamese.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>

            <p>
              In 1964 the Colorpoint Shorthair achieved championship status with the CFA, with cream and red point being the only recognised colours at the time. By 1969 the CFA would allow lynx and tortoiseshell point colorings. The breed is currently also recognised by the WCF, although without a published standard. It is not recognised as a breed by The International Cat Association, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy, and Fédération Internationale Féline.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Colorpoint Shorthair should have the appearance of a Siamese in type. It's a medium sized and slender cat with good muscle. The head has a long and tapering wedge and is of medium size in good proportion to the body. The gap between the eyes should be less than the size of the eye. The skull is flat. The neck is long and slender. Nose is long and straight. The ears are large, wide at the base, and pointed. The eyes are blue and almond shaped of medium size. The abdomen should be tight and hips shouldn't be wider than shoulders. The legs are long and slim. The tail is long and thin.
            </p>

            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>
              The color may be shaded or clear. The color may darken as the cat ages; however there is a contrast between the body color and the point colour.

              The <strong>Cornish Rex</strong> is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex has no hair except for down. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or "guard hairs", a middle layer called the "awn hair"; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. Occasional individuals are prone to hair loss or will develop a very thin coat or even go bald over large parts of their body. The curl in their fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. The breed originated in Cornwall, Great Britain.
            </p>
           
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and sometimes curly. Their light coat means that they are best suited for indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures. They like to stay near warm places such as computer monitors, light bulbs, laps and shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed is sometimes referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because of the sleek appearance and the galloping run characteristic of the breed. These cats tend to stay playful and kittenish throughout their long lives. Some Cornish Rexes like to play fetch, race other pets, or do acrobatic jumps. The Cornish Rex is an adventurous cat and is very intelligent. It can readily adapt to new situations and will explore wherever it can go. The Rex is extremely curious, seeks out the company of people and is friendly towards other companion animals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cornish Rex cats come in a wide variety of coat colours and patterns, outlined in the breed standard: solids, including white, black, chocolate, orange and the dilutes blue, lilac and cream; all forms of tabby including classic, mackerel and ticked tabbies, bicolor "tuxedo" coat in many colours, tortoiseshell, "smoke" colours and the colour-point pattern standard in the Siamese breed.
            </p>
            <h3>Genetics</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707425167/1312/Cats/Cornish%20Rex/800px-White_Cornish_Rex_atbo84.jpg" alt="Cornish Rex" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 2013, researchers identified the mutation that defines the Cornish Rex breed. Genome-wide analyses were performed in the Cornish Rex breed and in 11 phenotypically diverse breeds and two random bred populations. A gene on chromosome A1, the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6), was identified to have a 4 base pair deletion. This induces a premature stop codon in the receptor that is absent in all straight haired cats analyzed. LPAR6 encodes a receptor essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the hair shaft. In humans, LPAR6 mutations result in a form of ectodermal dysplasia characterised by a woolly hair phenotype.
            </p>

            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              The Cornish Rex is a genetic mutation that originated from a litter of kittens born in the 1950s on a farm in Cornwall, UK. One of the kittens, a cream-colored male named Kallibunker, had an extremely unusual, fine and curly coat; he was the first Cornish Rex. The owner then backcrossed Kallibunker to his mother to produce 2 other curly-coated kittens. The male, Poldhu, sired a female called Lamorna Cove who was later brought to America and crossed with a Siamese, giving the breed their long whippy tails and big ears.
                        </p>
            <p>
              The Devon Rex looks similar in appearance to the Cornish Rex but has guard hairs and sheds. The Devon Rex mutation is different from the Cornish Rex mutation in that the Devon has shortened guard hairs, while the Cornish Rex lacks guard hairs altogether. Crosses between Devon and Cornish Rexes are not permitted in pedigrees and matings between them will not produce a cat with short wavy fur. Another hair-deficient breed is the Sphynx cat, which has no hair but may have a very light coat of fuzz.
            </p> 
            <h3>
              Hypoallergenic
            </h3>
            <p>
              Despite some belief to the contrary, the Cornish Rex's short hair does not make it non- or hypo-allergenic. Allergic reactions from cats are not the result of hair length, but from a glycoprotein known as Fel d 1, produced in the sebaceous glands of the skin, saliva, and urine. Most people who have cat allergies are reacting to this protein in cat saliva and cat dander: when the cat cleans its fur, the saliva dries and is transformed into dust that people breathe in. Since Cornish Rex cats groom as much as or even more than ordinary cats, a Cornish Rex cat can still produce a reaction in people who are allergic to cats. It is, however, widely reported to cause lesser to little allergic reaction. It is recommended a potential owner visit a cattery to check their own tolerance.

              The <strong>Cymric cat
              </strong> (/'kU+026amrU+026ak/ KIM-rik, /'kʌmrU+026ak/ KUM-rik) is a Canadian cat breed. Some cat registries consider the Cymric a semi-long-haired variety of the Manx breed, rather than a separate breed. Except for the length of fur, in all other respects, the two varieties are the same, and kittens of either sort may appear in the same litter. The name comes from Cymru (Welsh pronunciation: ['kəmrɨ]), the indigenous Welsh name of Wales, even though the breed is not associated with Wales. The name may have been chosen to provide a "Celtic" sounding moniker for the breed. While the breed's Manx bloodline originated from the Isle of Man, the long-haired variant is claimed to have been developed by  Canada. The breed is called the Longhair Manx or a similar name by some registries.

            <h3>History</h3>

              According to the Isle of Man records, the taillessness trait of the Manx (and ultimately the Cymric) began as a mutation among the island's domestic cat population. Given the island's closed environment and small gene pool, the dominant gene that decided the cats' taillessness was easily passed from one generation to the next, along with the gene for long hair. Long-haired kittens had been born to Manx cats on the Isle of Man, but had always been discarded by breeders as "mutants". Then, in the 1960s, similar kittens were born in Canada and were intentionally bred. This was the start of the increase in Cymric popularity. It took many years for cat associations to recognize the Cymric as a breed of its own. While the Manx was recognized in the 1920s, the Cymric was not shown until the 1960s and did not gain popularity until the mid-1970s.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe, since 2006), World Cat Federation (WCF), Canadian Cat Association (CCA-AFC), Australian Cat Federation (ACF), New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF), Southern Africa Cat Council (SACC), American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA, of the US East Coast), and Cat Fanciers' Federation (CFF, in the US Northeast) consider the Cymric a separate breed. The Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China does also, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all the breed standards of its Western partner, ACFA; it is unknown if any Cymric breeders are actually in China.
            </p>
            <p>
              The International Cat Association (TICA) recognizes the Cymric as a variety of Manx, not a separate breed with its own standards. Also, simply covering it in their Manx breed standards, the US-based Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia (CCCA), and the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognize the variety as the long-haired Manx rather than a Cymric (the CFA] and CCCA call it the Manx Longhair, while GCCF uses the term Semi-longhair Manx Variant). The ACF formerly took this route, calling it the Longhaired Manx, but recognized it as a separate breed (Cymric) at the beginning of 2015, using the GCCF Manx standard (aside from coat length).

            <h3>Health</h3>

            <p>
              The genetic mutation that gives both the Cymric and Manx their unusual tails is also responsible for other health complications like spina bifida, a spinal defect that can result in neurological issues whether that is difficult with movement or waste elimination. A rabbit-like hop can sometimes be seen in Cymric cats due to the spinal deformity. Most of the time, these problems are identified before six months of age.            
            </p>

              The gene that gives the Cymric and Manx their unusual tails can also be lethal. Kittens who inherit two copies of the tailless gene die before birth and are reabsorbed in the womb. Since these kittens make up about 25 percent of all kittens, litters are usually small. Even cats who inherit only one copy of the gene can have what is called Manx syndrome. Not every Cymric with a short spine has problems or Manx syndrome. It is simply an attribute of the Manx gene, and its expression cannot be entirely prevented.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following updated genetic research, both the ACF and (less stringently) the GCCF impose special breeding restrictions on Manx cats (including the Cymric, however named and classified), for animal welfare reasons.

              The <strong>Cyprus</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Devon Rex</strong> is a tall-eared, short-haired breed of cat that emerged in England during the late 1950s. The breed is known for its queer appearance, with an oddly shaped head, large eyes, and the short and wavy coat.
            </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Beryl Cox came across a novel curly-coated kitten in Buckfastleigh, Devon in 1960 whom she decided to name Kirlee. Cox believed the cat to be related to the Cornish Rex which led to her breeding Kirlee with Cornish Rexes. When the queen gave birth the kittens all had straight coats, which led to the discovery that Kirlee had a different mutation than Cornish Rexes. Following this Cox began a breeding program to try and preserve Kirlee's mutation.             
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Devon Rex is a short haired breed with a medium build and a unique head type which gives the breed a 'pixie-like' appearance. The head is short with a broad wedge and the brow curving to a flat skull. The eyes are large, set wide, and oval-shaped. Devon Rexes' may have any eye colour. The ears are large and set wide apart with rounded tips. The coat is short dense and soft and curls inwards a little giving it a waved or rippled effect. Some areas of the body such as the neck may lack enough fur for the wave/ripple effect. The whiskers and eyebrows are crinkled and twisted. Devon Rexes may come in any colour.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              Hereditary myopathy is found in some Devon Rexes. It is caused by a genetic variant known as COLQ and it appears anytime from 3 to 23 weeks of age. Typically, there is a chance that the myopathy in the cats might stabilize, however, most of the time, the condition worsens and the Devon rex cats die from laryngospasm, after obstructing their larynx with food.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Devon Rex was found to be predisposed to feline atopic dermatitis in a retrospective study of cases of the disease.

              The <strong>Donskoy</strong>  cat, also known as Don Sphynx or Russian Hairless, is a hairless cat breed of Russian origin.[1] It is not related to the better-known Sphynx cat (Canadian Hairless) whose characteristic hairlessness is caused by a recessive mutation in the keratin 71 gene. The Donskoy's hairlessness, on the other hand, is caused by a dominant mutation.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Donskoy breed is able to be traced back to one kitten. This breed started in 1987 with the discovery of a hairless cat in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don by cat breeder Elena Kovaleva. She had rescued a blue tortoiseshell kitten, which she named Varvara. At around four months of age, the cat began to lose fur. Varvara mated with a local tomcat and produced a litter of kittens. Some were born hairless, and the others started with hair but lost it like their mother. These kittens are the founding stock of the Donskoy breed and were later outcrossed with European Shorthair cats.            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, breeders learned more about the Donskoy's hair loss gene. Unlike the recessive gene carried by the Sphynx, the Donskoy's gene is dominant. So, all cats with the gene either are born hairless or lose their coats as they grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Donskoy was first officially recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF) in 1987 and by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 2005. The standard of points describes the cat as being medium-sized and muscular, with large ears, almond shaped eyes and distinctive long, webbed toes. They require frequent grooming, in spite of their lack of coat. Over-bathing can cause the skin to become very oily.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Peterbald breed was originally created by crossing Donskoy with Oriental Shorthair cats to create a hairless cat of Oriental-type.[1] Matings between the Donskoy and the Peterbald are no longer permitted since 2000, and outcrossing is not permitted, except with the domestic shorthair, due to the effect of the Donskoy's dominant hairless mutation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visibility of hairless cats increased significantly in 1997 due to the Blockbuster film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and subsequently in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, where Mr. Bigglesworth (played by Ted Nude Gent) was prominently featured as the beloved pet of Dr. Evil. Important to note, the hairless cat featured in the Austin Powers franchise was actually a Sphynx cat not a Donskoy cat.
            </p>

            
              <h3>Breeding ban</h3>

            <p>
              Since 2014, it is illegal in the Netherlands to breed with parent cats which bear genetic mutations or other physical abnormalities that cause health or welfare issues in their offspring. The lack of protecting fur in hairless cats, such as the Donskoy, is one of these banned mutations in parent cats.
            </p>

            <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The most striking physical characteristics of Donskoy cats is its hairlessness. Unlike many cats, Donskoys lack whiskers as well. Donskoys are medium sized, muscular cats in build. Their heads are triangular, with large ears and eyes which give Donskoys an elf-like appearance. Donskoy skin is very wrinkled, especially concentrated on the face, neck, chest, and the base of its tail.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Skin and eye color can range in Donskoy cats. Skin pattern colors tend to appear faded. While  eye color can range from blue, green, amber, orange, yellow, or brown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some Donskoy cats may grow a faint fur coat during colder winter months, but the hair eventually falls off as warmer weather months return.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Donskoys</h3>
            <p>Donskoys can be segmented into four different categories, based primarily on the types of coats and the amount of hairlessness. See categories below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rubber Bald: Born completely bald these Donskoys will remain that way throughout their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flock Coat: Flock Coat Donsksoys are born with a light peach-fuzz like coat. Eventually as these Donskoys grow, they will often lose the fuzz and become completely bald.
           </p>
           <p>
            Velour Coat: Unlike the Flock Coat and Rubber Bald, these Donskoy kittens are born with a wavy, short coat and a bald spot of the top of their heads. The wavy coat is short-lived, as within the first year, the kittens will lose their hair. Some Velour Coat Donskoys will continue to have a small amount of fuzz on their face, legs, and tail. Other Velour Coat Donskoys will lose all of their hair and become completely bald.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brush Coat: Like the Velour Coat, the Brush Coat is also born with a short coat of fur; however, it usually bristly or wiry. These Donskoys have bald spots on their head, neck, and back and do not lose the rest of fur as they grow. Then Brush Coat Donskoy is the only type of Donskoy disqualified from the show ring.
           </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Not all cat registries recognize the Donskoy, and there are some concerns about the genetic health of the breed. The dominant genetic mutation causing hairlessness in Peterbalds[12] and Donskoys[13] could cause feline ectodermal dysplasia in its homozygous form, causing problems including poor dentition and compromised ability to lactate or sweat. Similar dominant mutations (such as in FOXI3) cause the condition in hairless dogs, and the symptoms in dominant-type hairless cats and dogs mirror those of human ectodermal dysplasia (which also results in sparse or absent hair).
            </p>
            <h3>Demeanor</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike some other cat breeds, the Donskoy cat is extremely social.[11] Beyond its hairlessness, the Donskoy cat is very intriguing and inquisitive and soft-hearted. Donskoy cats are typically active, therefore they require sufficient stimulation to keep them entertained. They spent more time moving around than the average cat. Due to their social behavior Donskoy cats do not do well being left alone for long periods of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, Donskoys are friendly and extremely intelligent. These characteristics make Donskoy cats ideal for training. The Donskoy cat's good and gentle nature, along with social demeanor, makes them perfectly suited for families and are also great with children. The general disposition of the Donskoy cat is loving and amiable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to their demeanor, Donskoys usually get along well with other cat breeds especially other playful cats. Their activity levels can cause challenges with older cats. Donskoys are capable of getting along with dogs as well, if properly introduced.

              The <strong>Dragon Li</strong> is a recently established Chinese breed of domestic cat (also called Chinese Li Hua or China Li Hua as a standardized breed, depending on breed registry). It was developed from a common landrace of cats in China, known as 貍花貓, Pinyin: líhuā māo, literally 'fox flower cat' (sometimes shortened to 花貓 huā māo or 貍貓 lí māo); the native cats are featured in some Chinese folklore stories. The derived standardized breed is recognized by China's Cat Aficionado Association (CAA), and was for a time by the US-based, international Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), later revoked.
              </p>
            <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The Dragon Li displays a unique golden-brown, broken-mackerel (also known as broken-striped) tabby pattern; distinctive ear tipping; large round almond shaped luminescent yellow/green eyes; and a strong full bodied stature reminiscent of its wild nature.
            </p>

            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              The eponymous Dragon Li is thought in China to be a natural self-domesticating breed by way of a wildcat subspecies, the Chinese mountain cat (Felis silvestris bieti). While this theory is still somewhat controversial, it has also not been scientifically disproven, and is therefore widely accepted as the origin of this breed within established breeding sources in China. (All other cat breeds in the world are known to be descended from F. s. lybica, the African wildcat.)
                        </p>
            <p>
              The Chinese character interpretation is based on a legendary description rather than a fully accurate contemporary portrayal of the lí hua māo, and as a result, this cat had been confused with the wild fox by the Chinese. For this reason, the literal translated characters for lí hua māo read as 貍 referred as 'Common raccoon dog'; 花 from 花纹 for 'pattern', referring to raccoon patterns; and 貓 'cat'.
            </p>
            <p>
              Li hua mau is the prevalent name for the original variety in China. More recently, the names Chinese Li Hua and Dragon Li have been used internationally for the standardized breed. The dragon is a potent symbol in Chinese folklore, standing for power and good luck.
            </p> 
            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              The Dragon Li debuted as an experimental-class standardized breed in Beijing, China, in January 2004 All-breed Judges Dolores Kennedy and Barb Belanger of the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) were guests of the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) and judged the event. There were four of these pedigreed Dragon Li in the United States as of 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2005, a male specimen named Needy, presented by its owner Da Han, was shown and won its class as first place CAA champion. The event was judged by John Douglas Blackmore of the ACFA. Needy was then "married" to a breeding partner in an elaborate mockup of a traditional Chinese wedding ceremony, attracting some press coverage. In February 2010, the Li Hua was accepted for showing in the miscellaneous class by the international (US-based) Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Since gaining international recognition, and due in part to its limited availability, the Dragon Li / Chinese Li Hua has now become of interest to cat fanciers internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chinese literary legend "The Cat for Crown Prince Conspiracy" (狸貓換太子 Lí Māo Huàn Tài Zĭ) utilizes a lí hua māo as its central theme. The story has more recently served as the basis for the third episode (rendered "Wild Cat Exchanged for Crown Prince" in English) of the Hong Kong television series Justice Pao (包青天 Bāo Qīng Tiān).

              Historical evidence points to the Mau being an Egyptian breed. The feline genome data published in the Pentascope document shows the Egyptian Mau to be very closely related to the Maine Coon, Korat, and American Turkish Angoras (not distinguishable from native Turkish Angoras). The phylogenetic tree published in PlosOne demonstrates that the Egyptian Mau belongs to the group of Western-derived breeds. The East Mediterranean/Anatolian group is omitted because breeds that supposedly originate in that geographic area do not do so.             
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1953 in Italy, Princess Natalie Trubetskoy saw a cat belonging to the Egyptian ambassador to Italy and after asking about the cat she persuaded him to help her obtain a cat from Cairo. She obtained a female named Baba who was later bred with the ambassador's cat. A male bronze tabby was born and he was bred with his mother to produce a female named Lisa. These progenitors were first shown in 1955 at the Rome Cat Show. English fanciers attempted to reproduce this novel breed by using Abyssinians, Siamese, and tabby cats which became the Ocicat. Princess Natalie travelled with her three Maus to the United States in 1956 and in the following year Baba became a champion. The American Maus are purpotedly from Baba although other reports claim they're descended from a pair named Gepa and Ludol, brought into the country in 1953.

            <p>
              The breed first received championship in 1968 with the Cat Fanciers Federation followed later on with recognition from the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1977 and The International Cat Association in 1979. By the 1990s there were breeders in North America, Europe, and Japan. The Egyptian Mau did not reach British shores until 1998 when the first Maus were imported by Melissa Bateson, 8 years after it received full recognition from the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).

            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              Egyptian Maus are a relatively rare breed worldwide. Fewer than 200 kittens are registered with the GCCF each year. In 2022, only 39 Mau kittens were registered at the GCCF, ranking the cat breed at position 27 out of 40 breeds in popularity. In 2018, the Egyptian Mau ranked at position 27 out of 45 cat breeds registered with the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA).
             </p>
             <h3>Characteristics</h3>

             <p>
              Egyptian Maus are considered by proponents to be one of the progenitor breeds of the modern domestic cat. The breed conformation is described as "a balance between the compactness of a Burmese and the slim elegance of a Siamese. Its medium-length body is muscular, with the hind legs longer than the front, giving the Mau the appearance of standing on tiptoes when upright."
             </p>
             <p>
              The Egyptian Mau is the fastest of the domestic cats, with its longer hind legs, and unique flap of skin extending from the flank to the back knee, which assists in running by allowing the legs to stretch back farther, providing for greater agility and length of stride. Maus have been clocked running more than 48 km/h (30 mph)
             </p>
             <p>
              Maus have an unusually long gestational period, about 73 days. The typical gestation period for a cat is 64-67 days.
             </p>

             <p>
              The Egyptian Mau is a muscular cat with notable features being their spotted coat and a tabby marking on their forehead that is said to resemble a scarab design. The head is gently rounded and of medium size. The ears are medium to moderately large, broad at the base with a bit of pointing at the tip. The hair on the ears is short and may have tufting. The eyes are round and large. The eyes are light green although kittens may have amber eyes. The body is of medium length with prominent shoulder blades. There is a loose flap of skin extending from the flank to the knee of the hind legs. The tail is of medium length and thick at the base. 
             </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The Egyptian Mau has a higher prevalence of urate urolithiasis than mixed-breeds. A review of over 5,000 cases of urate uroliths had almost half the population of Egyptian Maus as having had the condition with an odds ratio of 44.41. A Canadian study of over 10,000 examinations of uroliths in cats found that 14 out of 17 Egyptian Maus surveyed had urate urolithiasis.

              The <strong>European Shorthair</strong>called the European in FIFe and Celtic/European Shorthair in WCF, is a breed of cat. The term has also been used as an elaborate way of referring to common domestic short-haired cats of Europe, causing some confusion as the pedigree cats of this breed also should resemble the typical domestic cats of Europe.
             </p>
            <p>
              The role as the cat breed resembling the original domestic cats of Europe was held until the beginning of the 20th century by the British Shorthair, even though stockier than the majority of common European cats, until 1949 when the European Shorthair was recognized by the Fédération internationale féline (FIFe). The oldest known European Shorthair registered in FIFe was born in 1940.
                        </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              European Shorthair has its counterparts in Great Britain (British Shorthair) and the U.S. (American Shorthair), though these breeds have been bred for longer. The British Shorthair, however, was crossed with the Persian and selectively bred to become a cobbier cat with a slightly shortened muzzle and thicker coat. It was confusing for Scandinavian breeders that the British Shorthair was also called European Shorthair at that time, even though it looked different. Felinological associations recognized both types of cat as a single breed, meaning they were judged by the same standards during cat shows, until 1982 when FIFE registered the Scandinavian type of European Shorthair as a separate breed with its own standard.
            </p>

            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            
            <p>
              As of 2023, the European (Shorthair) cat breed is recognised by ACF, FIFe, LOOF, TICA (registration only), and WCF.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The breed resembles a domestic shorthair and is of medium size with a muscular body. The face is well rounded with well developed cheekbones. The ears are of medium size and slightly rounded at the tip. Eyes are round and open. The eye can be any colour including odd eyed. The neck is of medium length and muscular. The tail is of medium length, thick at the base with a rounded tip.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the US the European Shorthair had the highest rate of the condition with 53 cats having the condition out of a population of 78.
            </p>
            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              The breed has developed from the natural mouse hunters of Europe with the wish to strengthen the most desirable personality traits of the domestic cats. Most European Shorthairs are strong and active, and as a rule they are friendly towards people of all ages. They get on well with other cats and tolerate dogs well. European Shorthairs are intelligent and playful, and most of them are expert at keeping houses and gardens free of all types of rodents. They tend to handle changes and an active home very well, making them suitable for families with children.
            </p>
            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              The breed is mostly popular in Scandinavia, as there are still huge populations of similar-looking cats in Europe, and the European Shorthairs are for those appreciating a supple breed which has had a selection for a good temper. The European Shorthair is on the list of endangered breeds in Sweden and is the national cat of Finland.

              The <strong>Exotic Shorthair</strong> is a breed of cat developed as a short-haired version of the Persian. The Exotic is similar to the Persian in appearance with the exception of the short dense coat.
            </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an outcross by some American Shorthair breeders. This was done in secret in order to improve their body type, and crosses were also made with the Russian Blue and the Burmese. The crossbreed look gained recognition in the show ring, but unhappy American Shorthair breeders successfully produced a new breed standard that would disqualify American Shorthairs that showed signs of crossbreeding. One American Shorthair breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/American Shorthair cross proposed and eventually got the Cat Fanciers' Association judge and American Shorthair breeder Jane Martinke to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name Exotic Shorthair. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers' Association closed the Exotic to shorthair outcrosses, leaving Persian as the only allowable outcross breed.
             </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>

            <p>
              The Exotic Shorthair is a medium to large sized breed just like the Persian. The head of the Exotic Shorthair is round and large. The ears are small with a well rounded tip that face low on the head. The cheeks are full and rounded. The eyes are large and round. The tail is short compared to the length of the body. Just like the British Shorthair and the Persian the Exotic Shorthair comes in all different colour variations.
            </p>

            <h3>Longhair Exotics</h3>
            <p>
              Because of the regular use of Persian as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a 1 in 4 chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by the Cat Fanciers' Association, although The International Cat Association accepts them as Persians. Other associations like the American Cat Fanciers Association register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>Like the Persian the Exotic Shorthair is a brachycephalic breed, meaning that it has problems as a result of having the nose and eyes in close proximity to each other, giving the appearance of a pushed-in face. Some conditions common in the Exotic Shorthair are listed below.</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707434341/1312/Cats/Exotic%20Shorthair/Loonah-of-nosgoth-12weeks_gv5to8.jpg" alt="Exotic Shorthair" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
             <p>Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. Also referred to as brachycephalic respiratory syndrome or congenital obstructive upper airway disease, this causes upper airway abnormalities ranging in severity. The syndrome can cause increased airway resistance, inflammation of structures in the airways, and increased strain on the heart. Treatment includes weight loss, surgery, and avoiding humid or hot conditions.</p>
             <p>Calcium oxalate urolithiasis. A stone that crystallizes in the bladder and kidney.</p>
             <p>Corneal sequestrum. A necrosis of the cornea of unknown origin.</p>
             <p>Dystocia. An abnormal labor due to large-domed skulls.</p>
             <p>Feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Exotic Shorthairs, as well as Persians and other Persian-derived cats, have a high chance of inheriting PKD, a disease that can lead to kidney failure. Several studies using ultrasound scan screening have shown that the prevalence of PKD in Exotics is between 40 and 50% in developed nations. DNA screening for PKD is recommended for all Exotic cats used in breeding programs to reduce the incidence of kidney disease by spaying and neutering PKD positive cats.</p>

              The <strong>Tiffanie</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
   
            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>
   
            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Foldex </strong> also known as the Exotic Fold, is a breed of cat developed in the Canadian province of Quebec. The breed is recognized by one cat registry, the Canadian Cat Association. The foundation stock of the breed is the Scottish Fold and the Exotic Shorthair. Foldexes are medium-sized cats with a rounded face, short legs, and folded ears. The latter are the defining feature of the breed. Their eyes are well-rounded and wide open, with pair of ears with small and smooth-edged tips. They are described as intelligent and sweet. They were first registered as New Breed by the Canadian Cat Association in 2006 and then finally granted the Championship status in 2010.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
            In 1995, the Foldex was first exhibited in a Show Hall in Quebec, Canada. It was originally produced by crossbreeding a Scottish Fold with an Exotic Shorthair, resulting in a cat with a comparatively rounder head, shortened nose, and folded ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new breed received popularity among the public, with breeder Jeanne Barrette going on to working with the breed. Her contributions to the breed resulted in the Canadian Cat Association granting Foldex the status of Experimental Breed in November 1998. Eventually, it was officially accepted as a New Breed in August 2006.
          </p>
          <h3>Breeding ban</h3>
          
          <p>
            In order to protect the animal welfare, several countries and states have prohibited breeding with fold-ear cats, including the Netherlands in 2014, Austria in 2020, Flanders (Belgium) in 2021, Victoria (Australia), and even the birthplace of the breed, Scotland. Some countries have also banned selling of fold-ear cats, or the breeding with any cat that bears the gene mutation resulting in osteochondrodysplasia, so even breeding with some of the straights. Potential parent cats can be tested for this osteochondrodysplasia mutation before breeding.           
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, some of the major cat registries, such as the GCCF and FIFé, do not recognise, nor allow for the registry of, Scottish folds and related breeds due to their health issues.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            The Foldex is known for its signature small, folded ears with round tips. However, only half of all Foldex inherit the folded ears gene, known as Folded. Those with non-folded ears are referred to as Straights, whose ears grow straight in their adult stage like other cat breeds. Folded kittens' ears begin to show a visible fold between 21 and 28 days old.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Foldex's body stature is medium-built with strong muscles, short legs and a short neck. Their ears may resemble of Scottish Fold breed, but they only have one crease which folds forward and downwards, while Scottish Folds have multiple creases that result in their ears laying flat. Their coats vary from long to short hair, and are naturally dense and soft with variety of color and patterns. The Foldex breed has a round face with wide-open eyes. Their nose is longer than an Exotic Shorthair, but shorter than a Scottish Fold.
          </p>
          <h3>Temperament</h3>
          <p>
            Foldex cats have an affectionate personality and are loyal to their owners, enjoying petting and cuddling, and are considered to be great lap cats. Foldexes have the high curiosity drive to explore, and have an easy-going nature, approaching strangers without hesitation. They get along with children and other pets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Foldexes are ideal for potentiate owners who live in an apartment, as they are not vocal breed. The Foldex is an intelligent breed that likes to play with toys and puzzles.
          </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Even though the Foldex is an overall healthy breed, they are genetically predisposed to a risk of feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). They may develop cyst on their kidneys at an older age, making it important for older Foldex cats to get pre-screened for developing PKD. Foldexis can also be genetically predisposed to health conditions found in the Scottish Fold, such as congenital osteodystrophy, bone abnormalities, and respiratory issues. the average lifespan of a Foldex is twelve to fifteen years.
            </p>
            <h3>Care</h3>
            <p>
              Just like any other cat breed, Foldexes require regular claw trimming and teeth cleaning. It is recommended for a short-haired Foldex to be brushed weekly to distribute skin oils and remove dead skin. An occasional bath is also recommended. Long-haired Foldex cats need more frequent grooming, as their coat can get tangled easily and is more prone to matting and hairballs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Foldexes require tight diet management compared to other breeds, as they are more prone to obesity. Two portions of dry food with one portion of wet food per day is recommended to prevent them from becoming overweight; this is ideally divided into a morning and evening meal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Foldexes need lots of space to explore around the house, which provides them with daily exercise. A safe outdoor space can also be provided, for enrichment and further exercise. Foldexes require a high level of mental stimulation to keep their minds exercised along with body. Cat puzzles and toys are the great ways to intellectually engage with them

              The <strong>German Rex</strong> is a medium-sized breed with slender legs of a medium length. The head is round with well-developed cheeks and large, open ears. The eyes are of medium size in colours related to the coat colour. The coat is silky and short with a tendency to curl. The whiskers also curl, though less strongly than in the Cornish Rex. They may be nearly straight. All colours of coat, including white, are allowed. The body development is heavier than in the Cornish Rex - more like the European Shorthairs.
             </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              An early Rex-type cat from Germany was Kater Munk, a cat of the family of one Erna Schneider, that was born 1930 or 1931 in a village near then-Königsberg, German Reich (today's Kaliningrad, Russia). Munk was the son of a mahogany Angora cat and a Russian Blue. There were one (some sources say two) other curly cat(s) in the litter which was castrated early. Munk spread his genes plentifully among the village's cat population till his death in 1944 or 1945. The Schneiders valued the strong tom with a penchant for catching fish from the family's garden pond for himself, not for his curly coat; he was, it seems, referred to colloquially as a Preußig Rex ("Prussian Rex", in local dialect). German Rex researchers do not consider Kater Munk to be related to the German Rex breed and state that he was never bred.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the summer of 1951, a doctor in Berlin-Buch (Pankow borough), Rose Scheuer-Karpin, noticed a black curly-coated cat in the Hufelandklinik hospital garden. The clinic's personnel told her that they had known the cat since 1947. The doctor named the cat Lämmchen (German for "little lamb"). Her supposition that she must be the result of a mutation, was shown to be correct. Thus Lämmchen was the first breeder-owned Rex-type cat and the maternal ancestor of all the current German Rex.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707584648/1312/Cats/German%20rex/German_rex_alana_lvxjwd.jpg" alt="German Rex" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The first two German Rex deliberately bred were two Rex kittens from a 1957 litter of four, offspring of Lämmchen and the straight-coated son Fridolin she had with a stray black tom Blackie adopted by Scheuer-Karpin. Lämmchen died on December 19, 1964, or in 1967, indicating she had been very young when first sighted in 1947. She left a number of Rex and crossbred descendants - the last one of her offspring was born in 1962 - most of which were used to improve other breeds such as the Cornish Rex which was suffering from skin problems due to being descended from genetically impoverished thoroughbred stock. In 1968, the lineage hinged on the efforts of the GDR cattery vom Grund who acquired the last 3 Rex offspring of Lämmchen not sold abroad, and amplified the lineage with European Shorthair and mixed-breeds. A stock was established in the West through the efforts of the FRG von Zeitz cattery in 1973 which in the previous year had acquired their sample of the allele with the white female crossbred Silke vom Grund. After some years, the breed slowly became more plentiful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another Rex cat turned up in Berlin-Buch, apparently in the late 1950s. The tom named Schnurzel eventually contributed to German Rex breeding; it is not known how he related to Lämmchen but presumably he was a grandson of hers, as Scheuer-Karpin would let her cats roam free through the gardens and forests of Buch. Even in more recent times, the genetic legacy of Lämmchen if not Munk manifests itself on occasion in the Berlin area, such as Pumina, found as a stray inage of Preuss from Siegburg which turned up in 1979 in the Rhineland town of Siegburg does not appear to be related to be a German Rex proper; it is almost certainly not related to Lämmchen. Nonetheless, his descendants may have contributed to the German Rex lineage of today.
            </p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
   
            <p>
              A German Rex cat is very friendly and quickly bonds with its human. It is lively, playful, and intelligent. Its temperament is much the same as a Cornish Rex.
            </p>
   
            <h3>Genetics</h3>
            <p>
              It is not certainly known how Lämmchen relates to Munk, only that the German Rex mutation - on the same gene as in the Cornish Rex - is recessive, meaning it will only show when both alleles are "Rex", and that Munk is the first thoroughly documented Rex cat, though as stories of "children cuddling curly coated kittens" attest, Rex alleles turn up every now and then. Presumably, Munk sired many offspring with local cats, none of which would have had curly fur as the allele of Munk's straight-haired mates would dominate. In the following years, any curly-haired cats in the Königsberg area went unnoticed or at least were not bred on purpose; the allele nonetheless would have stood good chances to remain in the local cat population, as recessive alleles have a very low probability to disappear entirely.

              The <strong>Havana Brown</strong> was the result of a planned breeding between Siamese and domestic black cats, by a group of cat fanciers in England, in the 1950s. Early breeders introduced a Siamese type Russian Blue into their breeding. However, using current genetic testing, it is believed that almost none remain in the gene pool.
             </p>
            <p>
              It has been documented that self-brown cats were shown in Europe in the 1890s, one name given to these was the Swiss Mountain Cat. These disappeared until post-World War II, with the most likely explanation that the Siamese Cat Club of Britain discouraged their breeding. The Swiss Mountain Cat was never used in the breeding programs of the modern Havana Brown. However, they likely share genetics inherited from the Siamese.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Breed development</h3>
            <p>
              In the early 1950s a group of English cat fanciers began working together with an intent to create a self brown cat of Foreign Type. They called themselves "The Havana Group", later to become "The Chestnut Brown Group". This group of breeders created the foundation of the Havana Brown cat of today. The ladies credited with this effort include Mrs. Armitage Hargreaves of Laurentide Cattery, Mrs. Munroe-Smith of Elmtower Cattery, the Baroness Von Ullmann of Roofspringer Cattery, Mrs. Elsie Fisher of Praha Cattery, and Mrs. Judd of Crossways Cattery. These breeders, by selectively breeding a Siamese cat which carried the chocolate gene to a black cat that also carried the chocolate gene, were able to produce chestnut (chocolate) colored kittens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed continued to develop in the UK and became known as the Chestnut Brown Oriental and retained the Siamese conformation. Early in the breeding program, two kittens were also exported to Siamese breeders in the USA. Over the next decade, breeding took a different turn as genetic problems began to plague the new breed. It became necessary to utilize other breeds for genetic outcross and the phenotype began to evolve and develop into a different look than what the original breeders in England had intended. This change in direction tore apart the breeding group and caused many difficulties in continuing to progress the breed within the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. Soon, the Chestnut Brown cat was being produced in many colors, known just as Oriental with a numeric system to designate the coat color.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708294434/1312/Cats/Havana%20brown/Havana_Brown_o8e6ro.png" alt="Havana Brown" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              In the US, the imported kittens continued to be crossbred with the Chocolate and Seal Point Siamese, producing only Chocolate or pointed offspring, with the breeders selectively breeding for only self brown kittens. Genetic diversity quickly resolved any defects that were seen in the early imports. The breeders in the US desired to maintain the look of the cats that were imported and bred specifically for brown offspring. Thus, the cats in the United States have a different look than the cats being bred in England. The American breeders focused on maintaining the unique head shape and did not breed for extremes. This American bred version was moderate in every way, with a rich, warm mahogany color that consistently produced like offspring. In 1964, the Havana Brown was accepted for Championship status in the world's largest feline registry, The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Early this century, a group of breeders in England again began trying to recreate the vision of the early Havana breeders. They made good progress in isolating the chocolate genetics and were consistently producing chocolate, lilac and pointed kittens. In 2011 a registered Havana Brown was imported from Europe and bred back to their Havana orientals. This cats contribution, along with selective breeding for type, began to direct the look of some English Havanas away from its Oriental siblings, and moved them more in the direction of the Havana Brown. In June 2014 under the breed name Suffolk, this cat gained recognition by the GCCF. The alternative name was used because the GCCF uses the name Havana to refer to a self chocolate Oriental Shorthair, from which they wished to be distinguished. Although a Havana Brown is used in the breeding program of the Suffolk, they are not to be confused as the same breed. The Suffolk is much closer to the Chestnut/Havana Oriental than to the Havana Brown.
            </p>
            <h3>Features and behavior</h3>
   
            <p>
              The Havana Brown is a well balanced, moderately sized, muscular short-haired cat with a body of average length. Sterilized animals can tend to become larger and somewhat chubby. They are a moderately active breed, compared to other short-hair cat breeds. The coat color must be warm brown, typically reddish-brown, with no obvious tabby markings (note that kittens will always show markings but they resolve as the cat ages and dissolve completely by one year). Whiskers must also be brown and the eye color green. The head should be slightly longer than wide, but should never appear like a wedge. In profile, the nose/muzzle should have a distinct stop and change in direction at the eyes. Paw pads must be pink or rose colored but should never be black. Ears tend to be moderately large. A Havana Brown should have no extreme features; specimens should be attractive and moderate. Males tend to be larger than females and are average in weight compared with other breeds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Havana Brown is an intelligent cat that often uses its paws both to examine objects and to communicate with its owners. Curiosity brings them to the door as visitors arrive rather than preferring to be hidden as many cats will do. It is not unheard of for a Havana Brown to place paws on someone's thigh and offer a meow of introduction. It is playful and curious, but rarely destructive unless left without companionship. While many are 'lap cats', a few are more content just to sit quietly beside their human companions. On the other hand, many Havana Browns prefer to ride on the shoulders of their human and help with daily activities. They love to play in and groom hair - it happens so frequently that there are Havana Brown owners who don't even notice their cat doing it until it is pointed out by an observer. It is an odd trait that most Havana Browns share.
            </p>
            <p>
              Havana Browns become very attached to their family and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. They are curious and interactive and need to be a part of daily activities. It is common for the Havana Brown to become best companions with the family dog. Many owners also find it surprising how easily they can travel with their Havana Brown without the cat's objection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most likely explanation of the breed's name - and the one most shared by Havana Brown devotees - is that its coat color is very similar to that of the Havana cigars, however, some have also argued that the breed's name is also derived from the Havana (rabbit) which also shares the color. This is likely more accurate based on the recorded history in England.
            </p>
            <p>
              Very little grooming is required. A gentle brushing and wipe with a damp cloth once or twice a week, along with a good quality diet, will suffice for Havana Browns.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no known genetic diseases associated with this breed. They may have a slightly higher occurrence of gingivitis than other breeds, this being attributed to their Siamese ancestry.
            </p>

            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <p>
              The breed has been recognized for competition in the US since the late 1950s. It has been considered an endangered breed, since the breeding pool is very small. As of 2023, there were only 15 Cat Fanciers' Association-registered Havana Brown catteries and under 130 unaltered cats. Since that time, the breed has grown at a healthy pace. In 2023 there are now twice the number of catteries and breeders located around the world, with the majority located in the US and Europe.            </p>

              The <strong>Highlander cat</strong> (also known as the Highlander Shorthair, and originally as the Highland Lynx) is a new breed of cat. The unique appearance of the Highlander comes from the deliberate cross between the Desert Lynx and the Jungle Curl breeds, also recently developed.
            </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Highlander breed refinement began in 2004, to distinguish the breed better from its foundation stock, and to seek competition status in major breed registries. The name Highlander was adopted in late 2005. Starting May 1, 2008, the breed was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) for competition in the Preliminary New Breed class, and in 2016 was moved up to Advanced New Breed. TICA divides Highlanders into two varieties, under the names Highlander Shorthair (HGS) and simply Highlander (HG) for the longer-haired variation. In 2022, the Highlander was accepted as a championship breed in the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA).
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            
   
            <p>
              The Highlander originated as a crossbreed of the experimental Desert Lynx breed and the Jungle Curl, to add the latter's curled ears to the former. They are bobtailed or short-tailed, have spotted or classic bullseye markings, mackerel and resemble the bobcat. The Highlander has a long sloping forehead and blunt muzzle with a very wide nose. The eyes are wide-set and the ears are upright with a slight curl and a slight turn in the backward direction. Some have polydactyl paws but this is not a desired trait in the cats and have been proved to cause health problems in the knees and hips as the cats age. Highlanders have no known health problems, and are fond of water. The body is substantial and very muscular. Females can grow to between 10 and 14 pounds (4.5 and 6.4 kg), and the males between 15 and 20 pounds (6.8 and 9.1 kg). Despite the "big-cat look", the Highlander is a human-oriented, friendly and playful cat, and very active and confident. The Highlander displays tabby/lynx point or solid point coloration in various colors. Bicolored cats are not allowed in the breed standard. Although some cats are polydactyl, it is not part of the standard and it is a disqualification in the show ring.

              The <strong>Himalayan</strong> (short for Himalayan Persian, or Colourpoint Persian as it is commonly referred to in Europe), is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired cat similar in type to the Persian, with the exception of its blue eyes and its point colouration, which were derived from crossing the Persian with the Siamese. Some registries may classify the Himalayan as a long-haired sub-breed of Siamese, or a colorpoint sub-breed of Persian. The World Cat Federation has merged them with the Colorpoint Shorthair and Javanese into a single breed, the Colorpoint.
            </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Work to formally establish a breed with combined Persian and Siamese traits, explicitly for the cat fancy, began in the United States in the 1930s at Harvard University, under the term Siamese-Persian, and the results were published in the Journal of Heredity in 1936, but were not adopted as a recognized breed by any major fancier groups at the time. Brian Sterling-Webb independently developed the cross-breed over a period of ten years in the UK, and in 1955 it was recognized there as the Longhaired Colourpoint by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF)
            </p>
            <p>
              California cat breeder Jean Mill took a series of graduate classes in genetics at the University of California, Davis. By 1948, she was one of three breeders independently crossing the Persian and Siamese to create the Himalayan cat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separate US-based breeding efforts had begun around 1950, and a breeder known to sources simply as Mrs. Goforth received breed recognition from the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) near the end of 1957 for the Himalayan. Early breeders were mostly interested in adding Siamese colouration to long-haired cats, and therefore reinforced the stock by outbreeding to Persians only to retain the Persian trait dominance. However, by the 1960s, some were re-introducing Siamese stock and producing less "Persian-style" cats, In the 1980s, a concerted effort to re-establish the breed along more formally Persian lines ultimately caused the breed to be merged into Persian as a variant in some registries (e.g. in 1984 by CFA), and a decline in the "old" or Siamese-like specimens.

              The Himalayan is considered a colour variant of the Persian and not a separate breed by the Cat Fanciers' Association and the GCCF. The Himalayan is considered a separate breed by the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association.            </p>
   
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Like the Persian the Himalayan is a brachycephalic breed which predisposes it to health issues such as respiratory infections, epiphora, corneal abrasions, ulcers, and corneal sequestration. Himalayans are also suspecitible to polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary condition that results in cysts growing in the kidney. Himalayans have a higher incidence of feline asthma. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Himalayan was under-represented, with an odds ratio of 0.37. A study of cats presented to the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital that underwent radiography found 4 Himalayans out of a population of 16 to have hip dysplasia, higher than the 6.6% average for all cats.

              The <strong>Japanese Bobtail</strong>  is a breed of domestic cat with an unusual bobtail more closely resembling the tail of a rabbit than that of other cats. The breed was first developed in Japan, and registered officially in the 1960s. The breed has been known in Japan for centuries, and it frequently appears in traditional folklore and art. Japanese Bobtails are believed to be derived from domestic and feral populations of kinked-tailed cats widespread throughout Southeast Asia and southern China.
            </p>
            <p>
              As in most other breeds, Japanese Bobtails may have almost any color (or colors, arranged in any number of patterns). Predominantly-white calicoes (三毛, mi-ke, literally 'triple-hair') are especially favored by the Japanese and by cat fanciers, and strongly represented in folklore, though other colorations are also accepted by breed standards.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Feral and domestic cats with shortened and kinked tails were first documented in Southeast Asia and southern China long before the development of modern breeds. The kinked tail is highly variable and is a dominant trait. They ranged in appearance from being just slightly shortened (around 25 cm (9.8 in) long), to being seemingly abruptly cut off in the middle (around 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) long), to being bobtails (less than 10 cm (3.9 in) long). These cats were called "qilin tail" in southern China (after the mythical creature) and were traditional symbols of fortune and wealth. Charles Darwin described the widespread occurrence of this trait in The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868): "Throughout an immense area, namely the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu and Burmah, all the cats have truncated tails about half the proper length, often with a sort of knot at the end."
            </p>
            <p>
              A 2016 study has identified that the kinked tails in these cats are the result of a missense mutation of the HES7 gene. It is the same cause of the mutation in Japanese Bobtails, making it likely that the ancestral founder of the Japanese bobtail is originally from Southeast Asia or China and that the bobtail trait already existed prior to their introduction to Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is unknown when cats were first introduced to Japan, but they likely arrived through multiple introductions from trade with the rest of Asia. It is believed that they first arrived along with Buddhist monks in the 6th century, who kept cats as a means of preventing rats from damaging scrolls made from rice paper. They were initially regarded as luxury goods. The first documented mention of a cat in Japan is from the journal entry of the young Emperor Uda in March 11, 889. He described it as a gift which arrived by boat to his father, the late Emperor Kōkō.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1602, Japanese authorities decreed that all cats should be set free to help deal with rodents threatening the nation's silkworm population and associated industry. At that time, buying or selling cats was illegal, and from then on, bobtailed cats lived on farms and in the streets. Japanese Bobtails thus became the "street/farm cats" of Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 1701, in Kaempfer's Japan, the first book written by a Westerner about the flora, fauna, and landscape of Japan, German doctor Engelbert Kaempfer (1651 - 1716) wrote, "there is only one breed of cat that is kept. It has large patches of yellow, black and white fur; its short tail looks like it has been bent and broken. It has no mind to hunt for rats and mice but just wants to be carried and stroked by women."
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1968, Elizabeth Freret is the first known person to have imported the Japanese Bobtail to the Western Hemisphere from Japan. The short hair Japanese Bobtail was accepted for Championship status in the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1976. Recognition for the long hair variety followed in 1993. As of 2013, there are a number of Japanese Bobtail breeders, most of which are based in North America with a few in Europe and at least one in Japan; yet the breed remains rare.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Bobtail cats are considered to be a lucky breed and to own one promises prosperity and happiness. The tricoloured, Mi-Ke (pronounced 'mee keh') is known as the luckiest colour for this breed. There is a Japanese statue of a cat with its paw in the air called Maneki Neko (translates to 'beckoning cat') and is an artist interpretation of the bobtail. These statues are common in many Japanese shops as they are thought to attract good people.

            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708551019/1312/Cats/Japanese%20Bobtail/Cat_odd-eye_dy22dp.jpg" alt="Japanese Bobtail" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
   
            <p>
              This breed is good for families. Due to their affectionate nature, they are well suited pets for children and communicate with people using soft chirpy noises. This breed is highly attracted to water, very smart, and known for playful behavior, always full of energy and mischief. A very loyal breed, Bobtails make great companions.
            </p>
   
            <h3>Mutation</h3>
            <p>
              The short tail is a cat body-type mutation caused by the expression of a dominant gene. The tail is both shortened and kinked in Japanese Bobtails. The gene is fixed/always homozygous in the breed, so generally all kittens born to even one Japanese Bobtail parent will have bobtails as well. A bobtailed cat that is heterozygous for the gene may have kittens with or without the trait. Unlike the dominant Manx gene, the Bobtail gene is not associated with skeletal disorders. The Bobtail gene causes a reduced number of tail vertebrae, as well as some fusion of tail vertebrae. This type of tail is not only unique to the breed but also to each individual cat, no two are exactly alike. For it to be considered a true bobtail cat the tail must not exceed three inches from the point of extension to the tailbone.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Recent scientific studies on cat genetics led by researchers has indicated that the Japanese Bobtail breed is one of the most genetically diverse of pedigree breeds. Compared with other breeds, Japanese Bobtails tend to have smaller litters with the kittens being proportionally larger at birth and developing at a faster rate. Kitten mortality rates are reported to be comparatively low.
            </p>
            <h3>Odd-eyed specimens</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708551018/1312/Cats/Japanese%20Bobtail/JapaneseBobtailBlueEyedMi-ke_gmijum.jpg" alt="Japanese Bobtail" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Rarely, a Japanese Bobtail, especially a predominantly white specimen, may have heterochromia, or eyes of different colors. Regardless of breed, cats with this trait are known as odd-eyed cats. In this breed, one iris is blue ("silver" in Japanese breeding terms) while the other is yellow ("gold"). This trait is more common in this breed than in most others, with the notable exception of the Turkish Van.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, members of the breed are active, intelligent cats, with a strongly human-oriented nature, are easier to train to perform tricks than most breeds, and are more likely to enjoy learning human-mediated activities like walking on a harness and leash, and playing fetch. They are very attentive, alert felines that notice a lot. Considered an unusually "talkative" breed, they often interact vocally with people. Their soft voices are capable of nearly a whole scale of tones, leading to a folk belief that they can sing.
            </p>
            <h3>Folklore and legend</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708551019/1312/Cats/Japanese%20Bobtail/PD-Maneki_Neko_uafgxz.jpg" alt="Japanese Bobtail" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Cats are featured prominently in Japanese folklore. As in many other traditions around the world, cats are frequently objects of fear and mistrust, with various supernatural abilities ascribed to them. But in some Japanese stories, the length of their tails is an important plot point, with the Japanese Bobtail seen as auspicious, while long-tailed cats may be suspected of being nekomata, a type of evil spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The maneki-neko ('beckoning cat' or 'inviting cat'), an image of a Japanese Bobtail seated with one paw raised, is considered a good-luck charm among the Japanese around the world, who often keep a statue of this figure in the front of stores or homes (most often a stylized calico, though gold and black variants are also common). This stems from a legend that tells how a man (usually either a priest or member of the royal family) who owned one of these cats looked up one day to see his cat beckoning to him. Thinking the cat might have a message from the gods, he arose and went to it; no sooner had he done so than a branch large enough to kill a man fell where he had been sitting just moments before. Japanese Bobtails also feature prominently in traditional Japanese painting.
            </p>
            <p>
              One legend of the origin of the breed's short tail, tells of a sleeping cat whose long tail caught fire; it then ran through town, spreading flames everywhere. With the capital in ashes, the Emperor decreed that all cats should have their tails cut short as a preventative measure.
            </p>
            <p>
              While legends and superstitions may have favored the short-tailed breed, it seems likely that the Bobtail simply has a longer history in Japan than other recognizable breeds. It is also likely to have carried much prestige, having originated on the continent and arrived via Korea in the Asuka period (6th century CE), along with other prized articles of Chinese culture.
            </p>
            <h3>In popular culture</h3>
            <p>
              The manga character Hello Kitty resembles a Japanese Bobtail, and is an example of contemporary kawaii ('cute') pop culture. The character Muta from The Cat Returns was based on a stray Japanese Bobtail that would often visit Studio Ghibli. They also tend to appear in other anime produced in Japan.

In W Is for Wasted, by Sue Grafton (part of her alphabet mystery series), private investigator Kinsey Millhone and her landlord Henry Pitts acquire a Japanese bobtail and name him Ed. During a fight with a deranged murder suspect, Ed scratches the killer, thereby saving Kinsey from death by scalpel.

Mochi, Hiro Hamada's cat in the Disney film Big Hero 6, is also a Japanese Bobtail.

In illustrator Jey Parks's 2017 book Star Trek Cats, Hikaru Sulu is depicted as a Japanese Bobtail.

The titular cat Good Fortune in the Newbery Medal-winning book The Cat Who Went to Heaven is a tricolor Japanese Bobtail.

              The <strong>Javanese cat
              </strong>  also known as the Colorpoint (or Colourpoint) Longhair in some registries (though that name has other meanings), is a variety of purebred domestic cat.</p>
            <p>
              In the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), it is an offshoot of the Balinese breed, out-crossed to Siamese, Colorpoint Shorthair, and Balinese cats. Individuals have medium-longhair and non-traditional point coloration (lynx/tabby point, tortoiseshell point or red/cream point). The variety was developed in North America; its name is derived from the tradition of naming Oriental-type cats after Southeast Asian places.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on the cat registry in question, the Javanese may be treated as a stand-alone breed, considered a Javanese division of the Balinese, or subsumed with the Himalayan into a merged breed called simply Colourpoint. In others, the cats considered non-traditional colored Balinese cats by the CFA, are also accepted as Balinese cats. Confusingly, some registries refer to what other registries refer to as the Oriental Longhair as Javanese. (See § Classification below for details; this article focuses on the CFA breed/sub-breed.)

            </p>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              The term Javanese cat was coined by a Helen Smith of MerryMews Cattery circa 1950, but for a different variety she was working on. It is unknown if she had ever traveled to Indonesia. The name was derived from the tradition of using the names of the countries and islands of south-east Asia for Oriental cat breeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 1978, breeders of Balinese cats in Canada and the United States, affiliated primarily with the clubs Balinese Internationale and Balinese Breeders and Fanciers of America, sought acceptance from the US-headquartered, international Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) of their "new colors" (variations on the traditional point-colored Balinese). The cats were accepted for registration but not competition into the CFA in 1979, but only as a new breed rather than as a division of Balinese; the name "Javanese" (independent of Helen Smith's use of it in the 1950s) was selected by looking at a map and picking Java, an island near Bali. CFA awarded "Provisional" status in 1984, and the CFA Javanese gained full "Championship" status in the organization in 1986.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Javanese, under CFA definitions, was merged back into Balinese as the Javanese Division in 2008, to be more consistent with other registries' coat-color rules.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708552259/1312/Cats/Javanese/Javanese_cat_gfhe1r.jpg" alt="Javanese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <h3>Classification</h3>
   
            <p>
              In the Cat Fanciers' Association, the Javanese, now a sub-breed, is a generally Balinese-ancestry cat with a coat that does not follow the traditional and strictly defined point coloration patterns of the Balinese. Only "traditional" colored seal, blue, chocolate, and lilac solid colorpoints fall under the Balinese cat in CFA, and thus referring to all lynx (tabby), tortoiseshell and other point colourations in Balinese cats as Javanese. Well into the 1990s, it was still permissible to back-cross Javanese to Balinese, Siamese, and Colorpoint Shorthairs for genetic diversity within the Javanese line. Under current CFA rules, and after intervening breed redefinitions, only "certain limited outcrossing" is allowed (by special permission from CFA), and only to the Oriental Longhair (a related breed that has the same broad color range but body-wide, lacking the colorpoint pattern). All outcrossing will stop at the end of 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such Balinese with non-traditional colors are, in some other registries, named Colorpoint Longhair, though this term is ambiguous, and can refer to different breeds in some registries. In the World Cat Federation (WCF) scheme, cats that would be classified in other registries as Javanese or Colorpoint Longhair have been merged with Himalayan into a single breed, Colourpoint. In most registries aside from the WCF, the Himalayan cat is a separate breed, a cross between the Balinese and the Persian, limited to traditional Balinese/Siamese colors. To complicate matters further, some registries have instead applied the name Javanese to what other registries call the Oriental Longhair, which has no point coloration.
            </p>
   
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708552259/1312/Cats/Javanese/Javanesecats_jqv5ek.jpg" alt="Javanese" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Javanese breed has a long, silky coat in a variety of colors (unlike the actual native domestic cats of Java which have short hair). It is a single coat, in contrast to the double coat (with guard hairs) found in most long-haired breeds; as a result, it lies close to the skin, and produces a longer, sleeker look than is typical for long-haired cats. Like the Colorpoint Shorthair, the Javanese has point coloration (with a pale body and darker face and extremities), but is permitted to have coat colors and patterns not found in the Balinese or Siamese. These may range from dark brown to near white, and may be ruddy to bluish, tabby, lynx point, cream point, tortoiseshell (tortie), tortie point, and others, including unusual combinations ("blue-cream point", "cinnamon-tortie lynx point", etc.). In total, CFA defines 24 Javanese-division color combinations in addition to the four Balinese basics. Standard Javanese always have blue eyes.
            </p>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              It is noted as an intelligent cat and tends to vocalize, often for no apparent reason; this is also a trait of the Siamese ancestor. They are notably fond of play, jumping and human contact, vocalizing, and getting into whatever their owners are doing and can become depressed if not regularly entertained by humans or other pets. They are reportedly good mouse hunters.

              The <strong>Khao Manee</strong>  or Khao Plort (Thai: ขาวปลอด, lit. "complete white"), also known as the Diamond Eye cat, is a rare, natural breed of domestic cat originating in Thailand, which has an ancient ancestry tracing back hundreds of years. They are mentioned in the Tamra Maew (Cat Book Poems ). Khao Manee cats are short-haired solid-white cats.
            </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Khao Manee is an ancient cat breed comparable to the Siamese, Thai, Korat, Suphalak, and other natural cat breeds from Thailand. The Khao Manee is mentioned in the Tamra Maew (Cat Book Poems ) that also mention the Siamese cat breed and other different coat coloured cats endemic to Thailand, or Siam, as it was previously known.            </p>

            <p>
              In the Ayutthaya Kingdom (AD 1351-1767) there are many books about ancient Siam cats recording cats such as the Siamese/Thai, Korat, Suphalak, Konja, etc.. There are 23 species in Ayutthaya. 17 species were fed at the Ayutthaya royal palace, but there are no records about the Khao Manee. There are a few records about white cats, but no specific records about the Khao Manee. Only 23 species have been recorded.

            <h3>Thonburi Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
              After the Ayutthaya Kingdom collapsed during the Burmese-Siamese War (AD 1765-67), the Siamese people emigrated to the Thonburi kingdom (AD 1768-1782). One of the most important temples in Bangkok is in the Wat Arun. A Buddhist temple had existed at the site of Wat Arun since the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. When King Taksin established his new capital of Thonburi near the temple after the fall of Ayutthaya, the Khao Manee's historical records were found there.

              In the reign of King Nangklao (AD 1824-1851), the Khao Manee is more frequently mentioned. Khao Manee cats are famed and there have been paintings found of them at temples. The white cat was originally known as the 'Khao Plort', then became known as the Khao Manee in the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868-1910 AD).

             <h3>Introduction worldwide</h3>
             <p>
              The Khao Manee was said to be kept and bred initially by Siam royals, as was the case with other rare coloured cats such as the Siamese. Breeders in Thailand are promoting and breeding the Khao Manee in the effort of preserving its lineage and breed standard. The first Khao Manee cat imported to the United States arrived in 1999 when Colleen Freymuth imported 12 Khao Manees. In 2004, she was joined by Frédéric Lachaud-Goedert in France who began another breeding program. With the help of Janet Poulsen, an edifying contributor to the establishment of the breed, they worked to have the breed recognised in all the world's cat registries. Breeders in the West are still working to promote and establish foundation lines for the Khao Manee.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Thai breeders used to breed only white to white Khao Manees. This is the most distinctive trait of the breed. While most western breeders perpetuate this heritage by screening their genetic informations, other breeders prefer to cross their subjects with coloured Asian breeds of cats.
             </p>

             <h3>Popularity</h3>
             <p>
              The Khao Manees are currently probably the rarest feline breed in the world, therefore the prices are relative high. In its country of origin, the Khao Manee is very popular because it is associated with the monarchy but also because several legends of extreme felicity and healing were reported by the press. Known as the “White Gem”, the Khao Manee was rumoured to be highly coveted by Thai royalty is thought to bring good luck to those fortunate enough to have one. It's always in relation with religious discovery and about sudden fortune. Some stories mention sums going up to 150 million Baht (over US $4 million) in 1993 for a subject with eyes like precious stones which funded the construction of a monastery.

             <h3>Distinction</h3>
             <p>
              The Khao Manee is not to be confused with the Siamese or Thai, or any Siamese relative including the Foreign White, which was bred from purebred Siamese with one white-coated British Shorthair ancestor. Though both white cats have a common background, the Siamese cat and the Khao Manee have different genetic structures, bloodlines and breeding policies, thus Khao Manee are considered a completely different breed in the West, as well as in its native home of Thailand.

              The <strong>Korat</strong> (Thai: โคราช, มาเลศ, สีสวาด, RTGS: Khorat, Malet, Si sawat) is a silver-tipped blue-grey, short-haired breed of domestic cat with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat. Its body is semi-cobby, and unusually heavy for its size. It is an intelligent and playful active cat that forms strong bonds with people and is very vocal, with a sound different from other breeds. Among the Korat's distinguishing characteristics are its heart-shaped head, its large green eyes. Its front paws are shorter than the back paws. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Korat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds, and one of the very few that has not changed its appearance throughout centuries. Originating in Phimai, Thailand, it is named after its province of origin, Nakhon Ratchasima Province (typically called "Korat" by the Thai people). In Thailand, the breed is known as Si sawat, meaning "colour of the sawat seed". The Korat is known colloquially as the "good luck cat". Traditionally, they are given in pairs to newlyweds or people who are highly esteemed, for good luck. Until recently, Korats were not sold, but only given as gifts.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708625966/1312/Cats/Korat/1280px-Wichienmaat_Thai_cat_vpynlk.jpg" alt="Korat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The probable first allusion to the breed is in the Thai Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), authored between 1350 and 1767 CE and now in the National Library of Thailand. However, the illustration of the Korat in this book is not detailed enough to be definitive as to the breed portrayed. In recent years, the Korat was pictured on a postage stamp in Thailand. An example hangs in the city of Korat's post office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Korats first appeared in Britain under the name "Blue Siamese" in 1889 and 1896, but these solid blue cats did not conform to the cat show judges' perception of a Siamese cat, and they disappeared by 1901. One early import, "Dwina", owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs. Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903), reputedly produced a large number of "Siamese" kittens; the other, Mrs. B. Spearman's Blue Siamese male, "Nam Noi", was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, "Around the Pens", July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these "Blue Siamese".

            <p>
              Korats first appeared in the US in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the US for breeding: a male named Nara and a female named Darra. In 1966, the Korat was accepted into championship status, through the efforts of a breeder from Maryland.
            </p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708625967/1312/Cats/Korat/Thai_Lilac_aeusw1.jpg" alt="Korat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <p>
              The Korat's unusual colour is actually a silver-tipped blue that appears to shimmer. The Thais refer to this colour as "rain-cloud grey", and the shimmer as "sea foam". This cat has a single coat that is short, with roots of a lighter silver blue. The hair shaft colour increases to deeper blue and the tips are silver, especially on the muzzle and toes. This is the only colour accepted for a Korat. The eyes are large and peridot green in an adult cat, but kittens have muddy, amber or golden-green coloured eyes which gradually change as they become adults, at two to four years.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it is rare, Korats occasionally have striking or faint white markings or spots or even very faint grey stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size with age. These are seen as flaws, and the cats are disqualified from competing in cat shows. However, such markings have no effect on personality or health.
            </p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              The Korat has a very different temperament from other Thailand-derived cat breeds. They are intelligent, with a good memory. If they are brought to a place they have never been before, they can return home on their own. If they are living in a big group, they will use a hierarchy system. When fed, the sergeant of the group will eat first and then the other cats follow the hierarchy, though they will let kittens eat first. Female cats will teach their litters to survive and protect themselves by taking some small animal for the kittens to play with for practicing. Korat cats can remember their owner. If they see a stranger they might scare or make a noise, but they will run to their owner and play with them.

              The <strong>Siamese</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
   
            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>
   
            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Kurilian Bobtail </strong> is a cat breed (or breed group, depending on registry) originating from the Russian Kuril Islands, as well as Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka peninsula of Russia. Short- or long-haired, it has a semi-cobby body type and a distinct short, fluffy tail. The back is slightly arched with hind legs longer than the front, similar to those of the Manx. The breed is also called the Kuril Islands Bobtail, Kuril Bobtail (both often misspelled "Kurile") and Curilsk Bobtail, and may be referred to without "Bobtail". It is sometimes also spelled Kurilean. The original short-haired variant is a natural breed, known on the islands for over 200 years. As selectively bred pets, they have been popular in USSR and to some extent other parts of Europe, especially for their rodent-hunting abilities, since the middle of the 20th century, but remained rare in North America as of 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kurilians are recognized as a breed group of a pair related short- and [semi-]long-haired breeds by The International Cat Association (TICA), which considers them "Advanced New Breeds" ineligible for championship status, as of 2011) and by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe). The World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes them as a single breed. As of 2011, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) did not recognize the breed at all.            </p>
            <p>
              While possibly closely related to the Japanese Bobtail breed - both share the same kind of kinked, short tail, but the Japanese is leaner, more angular and less cobby - the Kurilian originated on the opposite side of Eurasia from the similarly named Karelian Bobtail of western Russia and Finland, and is thus unlikely to be a near relative. Genetic studies may eventually demonstrate the breed's connection to others. Just as the Japanese Bobtail and tailless-to-short-tailed Manx arose independently on islands a world apart, the Kurilian's bobbed tail may be an isolated spontaneous mutation that became common on the Kuril and Sakhalin islands because of the limited genetic diversity of island biogeography (an example of the founder effect and, at the sub-specific level, of the species-area curve).            </p>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              This new breed is not well known outside of its native territories. Though it is a native to Japan with a long history on a chain of islands, known as the Kurils, that runs from the easternmost point of Russia to the tip of Japan's Hokkaido Island. Also known as the Kuril Bobtail or the Curilsk Bobtail, because the Kuril Islands are Russian-owned, this breed is being developed and promoted as a Russian aboriginal breed that is separate and distinct from the Japanese Bobtail. There are several versions of the origin of the breed. The main origin of the breed is considered to be from a mixture (crossbreeding) of Japanese Bobtail cats with Siberian cats brought by sailors to the Kuril Islands. It was adopted by the WCF in 1994.             </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              In the wild, this cat is an excellent fisher and hunter, which may explain why the Kurilian loves to play in water. The Kurilian's wild look is not reflected in the temperament of the breed. It is known for its clever and gentle nature.            </p>

         
            <p>
              The variety is mostly known for its distinctive "pom-pom" kinked, short tail. Short- or longhaired, it has a distinct short, fluffy tail ranging from 2 to 10 vertebrae. The back is slightly arched, with hind legs longer than the front,. It has a medium to large, substantial, muscular build and rounded-rectangular, wide face. Eye colors conform to the color of the coat. The colors yellow, green, and yellow-green are preferred. There are semi-longhair and shorthair Kurilians. All colors without colorpoint and solid are allowed. Part of the reason for its rarity is that there are just two or three kittens in a litter. The most common coat colors are in red, to grey, to bobtail stripes. The lifespan of a Kurilian Bobtail ranges from 15 to 20 years, owing to their breed's being developed in the wild.            </p>

              The <strong>LaPerm</strong> is a breed of cat. A LaPerm's fur is curly (hence the name "perm"), with the tightest curls being on the throat and on the base of the ears. LaPerms come in many colors and patterns. LaPerms generally have a very affectionate personality.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Breed profile</h3>
            <p>
              The LaPerm is a rex breed which originated in the United States and is now present in many other countries worldwide. The breed is genetically unique and not related to any other rex cat varieties, having a dominant gene causing their curly coats. They have an elegant and athletic build and are affectionate, active, and outgoing in character. They are reputed to be hypoallergenic cats, provoking a significantly lower level of an allergic response in humans than normal cats. Their most significant feature is their coat, which is made up of soft waves, curls, and ringlets, resembling a shaggy perm.            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707777263/1312/Cats/La%20Perm/Laperm_LH_blacktortie_white_gthvfa.jpg" alt="LaPerm" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <p>
              The LaPerm emerged around the early 1980s as a spontaneous mutation of cats bred for pest control. The breed founders were Linda and Richard Koehl from The Dalles, Oregon, whose cat Speedy gave birth to a curly-coated kitten, named Curly, from whom all LaPerms descend. The Kohls allowed a free-breeding colony of curly-coated cats to develop over a period of ten years before making contact with members of the cat fancy and initiating a formal breeding program. The breed was named after their curly coat which bears resemblance to a shaggy perm. The name follows the Chinookan tradition of adopting French words while incorporating the definite article to create a new word; for example, in Chinook Wawa, 'pipe' is lapeep and 'apple' is lapom, (la pipe and la pomme, respectively, in French).
            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              The LaPerm is in many ways a cat of moderation with no extremes and is still true to its original type. It does however have an unusual coat. The breed standard describes a muscular foreign-type body, which is medium in size with longish legs and neck. The head is a modified wedge with rounded contours and a muzzle which is slightly broad of the wedge. In profile, the straight nose leads into a break between the eyes up to a flattish forehead. LaPerms also have rather broad noses, flared ears, and medium-large almond-shaped eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like other rexes, all colors and patterns are acceptable, although tabbies, reds and torties are quite common due to their origins. Also, the unusual colors from the early days of the breed have been selected for, so lilac, chocolate and colorpoints are popular. Newer varieties such as ticked tabbies, shades and darker points are also being bred.
            </p>
            <p>
              The coat itself is described as having a textured feel. It is not silky, having a certain drag on the hand like mohair. It is usually soft, although the shorthairs will have more texture to their coats. The coat is loose and springy and stands away from the body with no thick undercoat. The coat varies according to the season and the maturity of the cat but is essentially wavy or curly with the longest and most defined curls in the ruff and on the neck. There is also longer curly fur inside the ears, tufts at the ear tips and "ear muffs", or longer, silky hair on the backs of the ears. The longhairs have a curly plumed tail while the shorthairs have tails rather like bottle brushes, and both have long curled whiskers. The coat sometimes falls into a natural parting along the back.

            <h3>Breeding policies</h3>  
            <p>Breeding policies vary slightly between registries, but all encourage the occasional use of controlled outcrossing to maintain healthy genetic diversity within the breed's gene pool. A small range of pedigree breeds have been approved, as well as non-pedigree domestic cats. When undertaking outcross matings to non-pedigrees, reputable breeders seek out cats closely resembling the correct LaPerm body type with coats that are not overly thick. This practice continues the use of the kind of cats which composed much of the original foundation stock for the breed and helps to maintain genetic health by using the widest gene pool available. However, in some countries, such as the UK, there can be legal complications to selling kittens from such matings as pedigrees because of the Trades Description Act 1968 through which it has been established that the legal definition of a pedigree cat in the UK is normally one with a fully recorded three-generation pedigree. After outcrossing to a cat of unknown parentage, at least three generations must be bred to establish a full pedigree record.
            </p>          
            <p>
              In TICA outcrossing has mainly been with the domestic short-haired cat and domestic long-haired cat, although registration rules do allow other breeds to be used and bred down from towards the F3 generation which is eligible for entry in TICA cat shows.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) breeders used the Ocicat for a two-year period, terminating on 1 May 2002; LaPerms registered during this period were permitted to have an Ocicat parent, and by extension, one or two Abyssinian grandparents, as the Abyssinian is an approved outcross of the Ocicat. Currently, CFA breeders may only use non-pedigree domestic cats and after 2025 no outcrosses will be permitted in CFA. However, CFA accepts LaPerms for both breedings and showing with other breeds in their pedigrees if they are imported from another registry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The GCCF has the most strict of the registration policies and only LaPerms with a full three-generation pedigree (i.e. parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents) of the only LaPerm to LaPerm breeding are permitted on the full register. Only LaPerms or cats from a list of approved breeds are permitted in the 4th and 5th generations. Cats with non-approved breeds anywhere within their five-generation pedigrees, particularly those with other rex genes, cannot be registered as LaPerms. In order not to cause any damaging restriction to the breed's genepool a supplementary register also exists for the registration of LaPerms bred as part of an outcross breeding program. LaPerms can only be registered on the supplementary register if within their five-generation pedigrees only LaPerms and cats from the approved outcross list are present. In the GCCF this list comprises the Somali/Abyssinian, Asian/Tiffanie/(European)Burmese, Ocicat and Tonkinese. Domestic Shorthairs and Domestic Longhairs can be used in outcrossing but certain restrictions apply and the initial offspring are placed on the reference register and cannot be shown without first being assessed and approved by three judges. In other registries the approved list (with some slight variations) is used for outcrossing and cats of unknown parentage are not always permitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              In FIFe, which has its most active LaPerm breeders in Sweden and the Netherlands, outcrossing is done on a case by case basis. In antipodean countries, Somalis, Tiffanies and Orientals have also been used, but Domestic Shorthairs and Domestic Longhairs are now the preferred choices of an outcross.

              The <strong>Lykoi</strong> (commonly called wolf cat or werewolf cat) is a breed of cat derived from a natural mutation causing a form of hypotrichia found in domestic short-haired cats. The mutation has occurred in domestic cats over the last 20 years. DNA testing has been done by UC Davis to confirm that the cats do not carry the Sphynx/Devon Rex gene. The breed was developed by Patti Thomas in Vonore, Tennessee.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lykos (λύκος, lýkos, pl. λύκοι, lýkoi, Ancient: λῠ́κος, lúkos, pl. λῠ́κοι, lúkoi) means "wolf" in Greek.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although commonly described as looking visually arresting, perhaps invoking horror films to some owners, the felines have sweet-natured personalities and appreciate human affection, being labeled as "dog-like cats".
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              Lykoi vary from completely covered in hair to partially hairless. Sometimes, they may lose all of their hair resulting in them looking like a Sphynx, but it grows back. Lykoi are genetically distinct from the Canadian Sphynx. The hair coat is unique in appearance in that it resembles the coat of an opossum when mostly coated. Standards call for a roan coat (of any color, although black is most common), a wedge-shaped head, and a lithe body of solid weight without excessive bulk. Lykoi are said to be friendly and unchallenging in their behaviour. They display a high level of affection for their owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              A unique characteristic of the cat breed is that the Lykoi sheds a lot when older, but regrows its hair later in life depending on the season.

The missing coat of the Lykoi's face gives the breed a wolf-like appearance.
            </p>
            <h3>History of the cat breed</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707258319/1312/Cats/Lykoi/8-month-old_male_Lykoi_eek73c.jpg" alt="Lykoi" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <p>
              Two different sets of domestic short-hairs with the Lykoi gene were adopted from a rescue after being discovered in Virginia in 2010, by Patti Thomas, who co-founded and named the breed, and in 2011, a second pair were located in Tennessee, by Johnny Gobble.
             </p>
             <p>
              In The International Cat Association (TICA) registry, the Lykoi went before the board in 2012 and was passed to "Registration Only" status by unanimous consent. The breed is now recognized as a Championship Breed and were able to begin competing against other Championship breeds from May 2017, with TICA. Work is currently being done to expand the breeding program.
             </p>
             <p>
              In The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), Lykoi of all colors are accepted and compete in Championship Breed beginning 2023–2024.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Lykoi is a naturally occurring gene in the feral cat population. The Lykoi breed was founded in 2011 by Johnny Gobble, Brittney Gobble, and Patti Thomas when two unrelated litters of kittens were presented to the founders as unique cats. The Gobbles did careful health evaluations to ensure that the cat's unusual appearance was not caused by sickness or disease. To prove that it was a gene, Johnny Gobble bred two of the unrelated cats to produce the first intentionally bred Lykoi. Since the mother to one litter was a black domestic, extensive outcrossing with short-haired black domestic cats began. With time, it was determined that the gene was recessive, and to continue to reduce genetic inbreeding, more outcrossing with the black domestic cats was done. There are still Lykoi cats born to the feral cat population, and sometimes they can be used in the breeding program. Once Championship status is reached, there should be enough outcrossing to ensure that inbreeding is minimal.
             </p>
            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>
              At the University of Tennessee, dermatologists examined them for any skin abnormalities. Along with biopsy samples of the skin, the dermatologists could find no reason for the coat pattern. What they did find is that some hair follicles lacked all the necessary components required to create hair (which is why Lykoi lack an undercoat). They also found that the follicles that were able to produce hair lacked the proper balance of these components to maintain the hair (which is why Lykoi do molt and can become almost completely bald from time to time). It was determined, with test breeding, to be true natural mutation.

              The <strong>Maine Coon</strong>  is a large domesticated cat breed. It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America. The breed originated in the U.S. state of Maine, where it is the official state cat. </p>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon is a large and social cat, which could be the reason why it has a reputation of being referred to as "the gentle giant." The Maine Coon is predominantly known for its size and dense coat of fur which helps it survive in the harsh climate of Maine. The Maine Coon is often cited as having "dog-like" characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to its large size, professionals have noticed certain health problems, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon is one of the largest domesticated cats. It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback, in 2020 becoming the third most popular pedigree cat breed in the world.
            </p>
            <h3>Myths</h3>

            <p>
              Maine Coon cats originated in Maine. However, their lineage is surrounded by mystery, folk tales, and myths. One myth claims the Maine Coon cat is a hybrid with another animal species, such as the raccoon or bobcat. The second myth states the cats are descendants of Viking ship's cats, known today as the Norwegian Forest cats. A third story involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora or possibly Siberian cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, all of her pets managed to reach the shore of Wiscasset, Maine, safely, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Science</h3>
            <p>
              These myths and theories have long speculated that the long-haired Maine Coon cat has to be related to other long-haired breeds, due to their similarities in phenotype. And for the Maine Coon in particular, that it is descended from the Norwegian or Siberian Forest cat, brought to New England by settlers or Vikings. However, phylogenetic studies showed that the Maine Coon belongs to the Western European monophyletic cat branch, but forms the closest relationship with the random-bred cat population in the Northeastern US (New York region). This Western European branch also contains the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cat, but they fall under a different sub-branch. The Maine Coons are descendants of cats brought to New England by Puritan settlers in the 1600-1700s, and out of the European cats they are genetically closest to cats found in the United Kingdom. It is not relatedness that makes them look similar to the Norwegian and Siberian Forest cats, but convergent evolution. These breeds all formed in harsh climates in which natural selection pressures for similar qualities. Thick, long coats, toe and ear tufts, big bodies, and snowshoe-like big feet, are useful traits in all the harsh climates where these breeds originate from.

            <h3>Cat shows and popularity</h3>   
            <p>
              The first mention of Maine Coon cats in a literary work was in 1861, in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903). F.R. Pierce, who owned several Maine Coons, wrote a chapter about the breed. During the late 1860s, farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and held the "Maine State Champion Coon Cat" contest at the local Skowhegan Fair.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 20th century, the Maine Coon's popularity began to decline with the introduction of other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Ethylin Whittemore, Alta Smith, and Ruby Dyer in an attempt to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine Coon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon was denied provisional breed status—one of the three steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA to be able to compete in championship competitions—by the CFA three times, which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973. The breed was accepted by the CFA under provisional status on May 1, 1975, and was approved for championship status on May 1, 1976. The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official state cat. Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat characterized by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, strong jawline, rectangular body shape, an uneven two-layered coat with longer guard hairs over a silky satin undercoat, and a long, bushy tail.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707827200/1312/Cats/Maine%20Coon/MCO_Nicolas_Real_Hero_Backwoods__8636797293_eeggq0.jpg" alt="Maine Coon" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <h3>Fur coat</h3>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon is a long- or medium-haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, although texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the head and shoulders and longer on the stomach and flanks, with some cats having a leonine ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed compared to other long-haired breeds, as their double coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maine Coons have several physical adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow. It can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a frozen surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside can keep warm more easily.
            </p>

            <h3>Coat colors</h3>
            <p>
              Maine Coons can have any colors that other cats have. Colors indicating crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the "ticked" patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards. This is not universal; the ticked pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA and CFA. The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby. All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, with the exception of blue or odd-eyes, i.e. heterochromia iridium (two eyes of different colors), in cats possessing coat colors other than white.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
              Maine Coons are regarded as "gentle giants" and possess above-average intelligence, making them relatively easy to train. They are known for being loyal to their family and cautious—but not mean—around strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a "lap cat," but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children. Many Maine Coons have a fascination with water and some speculate that this personality trait comes from their ancestors, who were aboard ships for much of their lives. Maine Coons are also well known for being very vocal cats, using trills and chirps to communicate their physical and emotional needs i.e. hunger, thirst, desire to play. Their frequent chirping and trilling is often a sign of happiness and excitement. They also make other loud vocalizations such as yowling or howling.
            </p>

            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>
              The Maine Coon was considered the largest breed of domestic cat until the introduction of the Savannah cat in the mid 1980s, and is still the largest non-hybrid breed. On average, males weigh from 18 to 22 lb (8.2 to 10.0 kg), with females weighing from 12 to 15 lb (5.4 to 6.8 kg). The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16 in (25 and 41 cm) and they can reach a length of up to 38 in (97 cm), including the tail, which can reach a length of 14 in (36 cm) and is long, tapering, and heavily furred, almost resembling a raccoon's tail. The body is solid and muscular, which is necessary for supporting their weight, and the chest is broad. Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature; their full size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old, while other cats take about one year.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2010, the Guinness World Records accepted a male purebred Maine Coon named "Stewie" as the "Longest Cat", measuring 48.5 in (123 cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Stewie died on February 4, 2013, from cancer at his home in Reno, Nevada, at age 8. As of 2015 the living record-holder for "Longest Cat" is "Ludo", measuring 46.59 in (118.3 cm). He lives in Wakefield, England, in the United Kingdom. Large Maine Coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes, although with a much lighter build and lower height.
            </p>
            <h3>Heart</h3>
            <p>
              Pet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003-2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at > 12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more. Maine Coons are generally a healthy and hardy breed that is adapted to survive the challenging climate of New England. The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats, whether purebred or not. In Maine Coons, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Middle-aged to older cats and males are thought to be predisposed to the disease. HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart, and sudden death.
            </p>
            <p>
              A specific mutation that causes HCM, for which testing services are offered, is seen in Maine Coons. Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive. Not all cats that test positive will have clinical signs of the disease, and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3%) in this study. Early growth and nutrition, larger body size, and obesity may be environmental modifiers of genetic predisposition to HCM.
            </p>
            <h3>Kidney</h3>
            <p>
              Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited condition in cats that causes multiple cysts (pockets of fluid) to form in the kidneys. These cysts are present from birth. Initially, they are very small, but they grow larger over time and may eventually disrupt kidney function, resulting in kidney failure. While renal cysts are observed with a low incidence in Maine Coons, PKD appears to be a misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6 mm in diameter) and located at the corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, number, and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. 'Maine Coon PKD' thus appears to represent a form of juvenile nephropathy other than AD-PKD.

              Another potential health problem is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), another genetically inherited disease that causes the loss of the spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3-4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened lifespan. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.

              Hip dysplasia is an abnormality of the hip joint which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database. The hip dysplasia registry (public and private) collected by OFA through April 2015 also showed that there were 2,732 cats that suffered from hip dysplasia, of which 2,708 (99.1%) were Maine Coons. Dysplasia was more severe in bilateral than unilateral cases and with increasing age.
            </p>
            <h3>Polydactylism</h3>
            <p>
              Many of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on a paw). With the 1970s revival of the interest in the breed, Maine Coon cats were noted to show an increased incidence of polydactylism compared to other breeds. Subsequently, breeders of show-standard cats were advised to regard this variation as undesirable and to offer affected kittens as household pets. The trait later became separately certified by some organizations, like The International Cat Association (TICA). Meanwhile, in increasing numbers of cat fancy competitions, the trait is no longer marked down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring, since it is not allowed by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene. The polydactylism are genetic problems which are not encouraged for breeding.  Polydactyly in Maine Coon cats is characterised by broad phenotypic diversity. Polydactyly not only affects digit number and conformation, but also carpus and tarsus conformation. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the fact that it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Some private organizations and breeders were created in order to preserve polydactylism in Maine Coon cats.
            </p>
            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p>
              Maine Coons also seem to be predisposed to develop entropion, mainly on the lateral aspect of the eyelids, which can lead to corneal irritation and ulceration, and may require surgery.
            </p>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              Maine Coon cats eat an animal protein-based diet. Like all other cats, they are obligate carnivores. They need to consume high levels of protein to fuel their high activity levels and keep their body fit and healthy. Protein-rich, low grain dry-food, wet food, raw food, or a combination of all three are best for Maine Coon kittens and cats.

              The <strong>Manx </strong>  (/'mæŋks/, in earlier times often spelled Manks) is a breed of domestic cat (Felis catus) originating on the Isle of Man, with a mutation that shortens the tail. Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed, along with elongated hind legs and a rounded head. Manx cats come in all coat colours and patterns, though all-white specimens are rare, and the coat range of the original stock was more limited. Long-haired variants are sometimes considered a separate breed, the Cymric.
             </p>
            <p>
              Manx are prized as skilled hunters, and thus have often been sought by farmers with rodent problems, and been a preferred ship's cat breed. They are said to be social, tame and active. An old local term for the cats on their home island is stubbin or rumpy. Manx have been exhibited in cat shows since the 1800s, with the first known breed standard published in 1903.            </p>
              
              <h3>History</h3>
              <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707828850/1312/Cats/Manx/Manx_Silverwing_xiwbgp.jpg" alt="Manx" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Tailless cats, then called stubbin (apparently both singular and plural) in colloquial Manx language, were known by the early 19th century as cats from the Isle of Man, hence the name, where they remain a substantial but declining percentage of the local cat population. The taillessness arose as a natural mutation on the island, though folklore persists that tailless domestic cats were brought there by sea. They are descended from mainland stock of obscure origin. Like all house cats, including nearby British and Irish populations, they are ultimately descended from the African wildcat (Felis lybica) and not from native European wildcats (Felis silvestris), of which the island has long been devoid.            </p>
            <p>
              The dominant trait of taillessness arises from a spontaneous mutation, the Manx taillessness gene, that eventually became common on the island because of the limited genetic diversity of island biogeography (an example of the founder effect and, at the sub-specific level, of the species-area curve).
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Manx language, the modern name of the breed is kayt Manninagh, literally 'cat of Mann' (plural kiyt or kit), or kayt cuttagh lit. 'bob-tailed cat'. Kayt, used as both a masculine and feminine noun, is also encountered as cayt, and depending on the exact construction, it may be lenited as chayt or gayt.:138 The diminutive word is pishin or pishyn, 'kitten' (with various plurals). Manx itself was often spelled Manks in English well into the late 1800s.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707828850/1312/Cats/Manx/A_Rumpy_Manx_Cat_o6ntzp.jpg" alt="Manx" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              There are numerous folktales about the Manx cat, all of them of "relatively recent origin"; they are focused entirely on the lack of a tail, and are devoid of religious, philosophical, or mythical aspects found in the traditional Irish-Norse folklore of the native Manx culture, and in legends about cats from other parts of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name of the promontory Spanish Head on the coast of the island is often thought to have arisen from the local tale of a ship of the Spanish Armada foundering in the area, though there is no evidence to suggest this actually occurred. Folklore has further claimed that a tailless cat swam ashore from said shipwreck, and thus brought the trait to the island. However, tailless cats are not commonly known in Spain, even if such a shipwreck were proven.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of the genetic and historical reality, there are various fanciful Lamarckian folktales that seek to explain why the Manx has a truncated tail. In one of them, the biblical Noah closed the door of the Ark when it began to rain, and accidentally cut off the tail of the Manx cat who had almost been left behind. Over the years a number of cartoons have appeared on postcards from the Isle of Man showing scenes in which a cat's tail is being run over and severed by a variety of means including a motorcycle, a reference to motorcycle racing being popular on the island, and an update of the Noah story. Because the gene is so dominant and "invades" other breeds when crossed (often without owner knowledge) with the Manx, there was a folk belief that simply being in the proximity of a Manx cat could cause other breeds to somehow produce tailless kittens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another genetically impossible account claimed that the Manx was the hybrid offspring of a cat and a rabbit, purporting to explain why it has no or little tail, long hind legs and a sometimes hopping gait. The cat-rabbit halfbreed tale has been further reinforced by the more widespread "cabbit" folktale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Populations of tailless cats also exist in a few other places in Europe, most notably Cornwall, only 250 miles (400 km) from the Isle of Man. A population on the small, isolated Danish peninsula (former island) of Reersø in the Great Belt may be due to the arrival on the island of cats of Manx origin, by ship. Similar cats are also found in Crimea, a near-island peninsula in the Black Sea, though whether they are genetically related to maritime Manx cats or are a coincidentally similar result of insular genetic diversity limitations, like the unrelated Kuril Islands Bobtail, Karelian Bobtail, Japanese Bobtail, and Indonesian Lombok cats, is unknown. The Manx gene may be related to the similarly dominant tail suppression gene of the recent American Bobtail breed, but Manx, Japanese Bobtails and other short-tailed cats are not used in its breeding program, and the mutation seems to have appeared in the breed spontaneously. Possible relation to the Pixie-bob breed, which also ranges from rumpy to fully tailed, is unknown.

            <p>
              Manx cats have been exhibited in cat shows, as a named, distinct breed (and with the modern spelling "Manx"), since the late 1800s. In that era, few shows provided a Manx division, and exhibited specimens were usually entered under the "Any Other Variety" class, where they often could not compete well unless "exceptionally good in size and markings". Early pet breeding and showing expert Charles Henry Lane, himself the owner of a prize-winning rare white rumpy Manx named Lord Luke, published the first known (albeit informal) breed standard for the Manx in his 1903 Rabbits, Cats and Cavies, but noted that already by the time of his writing "if the judge understood the variety" a Manx would be clearly distinguishable from some other tailless cat being exhibited, "as the make of the animal, its movements and its general character are all distinctive."Not all cat experts of the day were favourable toward the breed; in The Cat: Its Points and Management in Health and Disease, Frank Townend Barton wrote in 1908: "There is nothing whatever to recommend the breed, whilst the loss of the tail in no way enhances its beauty."
            </p>
            <p>
              The Manx was one of the first breeds recognised by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) (the predominant United States-based pedigreed cat registry, founded in 1908), which has records on the breed in North America going back to the 1920s.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Variants (sub-breeds)</h3>
            <p>
              Four new, consistent varieties have been developed from the Manx (the original version of which is now sometimes consequently called the Shorthair Manx). These are the Cymric (Longhair Manx), the Isle of Man Shorthair and Isle of Man Longhair, and the Tasman Manx, though only the Cymric has garnered widespread acceptance in breed registries as of 2014.
            </p>
            <p>Cymric (Manx Longhair)</p>
            <p>
              The Cymric or Manx Longhair is a tailless or partially tailed cat of Manx stock, with semi-long to long hair, e.g. as the result of cross-breeding with Himalayan, Persian and other longer-haired breeds early in its development. While its name refers to Wales (Cymru), the breed was actually developed in Canada, which has honoured the breed with a commemorative 50-cent coin in 1999.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simply covering it in their Manx breed standards, the US-based Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia (CCCA), and the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognise the variety as a longer-haired Manx rather than "Cymric" (the CFA and CCCA call it the Manx Longhair, while GCCF uses the term Semi-longhair Manx Variant). The majority of cat registries have explicit Cymric standards (published separately or along with Manx). Of the major registries, only the Feline Federation Europe (FFE) does not recognise the breed or sub-breed at all, under any name, as of October 2014 (their Manx standard was last updated 17 May 2004).
            </p>
            <p>Isle of Man Shorthair (tailed)</p>
            <p>
              Resembling the British Shorthair, the Isle of Man Shorthair is essentially a fully tailed Manx cat. That is, it is a cat of Manx stock, with Manx features, but without any expression of the Manx taillessness gene. As of March 2013, it is only recognised by New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) with its own breed standard. Any coat colour and pattern acceptable in the British Shorthair is permissible in the IoM Shorthair (the same restriction is applied to the Manx in the NZCF standard), and it requires the double coat of the Manx. In other international registries (e.g. GCCF, who also treat Manx as a British Shorthair variant), such cats are designated "Tailed Manx" and only recognised as Manx breeding stock (they are important as such, since breeding two tailless Manx together results in birth defects), and cannot be show cats.
            </p>
            <p>Isle of Man Longhair (tailed)</p>
            <p>
              Essentially a fully tailed Cymric cat, i.e., a cat of Cymric (and thus Manx) stock, the Isle of Man Longhair has Cymric features, but without expression of the Manx taillessness gene. As of March 2013, it is only recognised as a separate breed by NZCF with a breed standard. Coat colours are limited to those acceptable in the British Shorthair, and requires the double, thick, long coat of the Cymric.
            </p>
            <p>Tasman Manx (curly-coated)</p>
            <p>
              Named after Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, the Tasman Manx is a tailless or partially tailed Manx cat with a curly-haired coat not unlike that of a Selkirk Rex, due a recessive mutation which arose in Manx litters in both Australia and New Zealand. As of March 2013, the breed is only recognised by the NZCF and the Catz Inc. registry (also of New Zealand) with breed standards. The coat may be short or semi-long.
            </p>
            <p>
              The type arose possibly without existing rex mutation bloodlines (and none of the rex breeds are permitted as out-cross partners with Tasman Manx in Catz breeding guidelines). Depending on length of tail (if any) and coat, kittens may sometimes be termed "Tasman Cymric", "Tasman Isle of Man Shorthair" or "Tasman Isle of Man Longhair", but these are not considered separate breeds. The term "Tasman Rex" has been applied to cats with this gene that do not fall into one of the previously mentioned labels (lacking the Manx face and body shape to qualify), though relation if any to extant Rex mutation breeds is unclear. All of these additional terms beyond "Tasman Manx" appear to be "recognised", even promulgated by NZCF but without breed standards, and even the permissive Catz registry does not include them as of July 2014.
            </p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              Fancier's often describe the Manx as being doglike in behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              These beliefs about the Manx's behaviour were not described in the past. Lane's early and experienced account of the temperament of this "variety, which is quaint and interesting" is simply that they were "docile, good-tempered and sociable", and that a prize specimen should be "an alert, active animal of much power and energetic character."
            </p>
            <p>
              Manx are prized as hunters, known to take down larger prey (e.g. adult rats) even when they are young, and were thus long in demand for working roles like farm cat (Manx: lughder or lugher 'mouser', from lugh 'mouse') and ship's cat (screeberagh or screeberey loosely 'scratcher, scratchy-one', from screebagh or screebey 'scratching, scratchy, scraping').
             </p>
             <h3>Isle of Man national symbol</h3>
             <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707828850/1312/Cats/Manx/1024px-Isle_of_Man_1_Crown_1970_Elizabeth_II_rev_-4040_xtny6n.jpg" alt="Manx" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
             <p>
              The Isle of Man uses the Manx cat as one of the symbols of the island nation and its unique culture. On Isle of Man currency, Manx cats are the subject of the reverse of four special commemorative crown coins. The first two, issued in 1970 and 1975, are stand-alone releases in both copper-nickel and silver proofs, while the third, in 1988, inaugurated an ongoing series of annual cat coin issues that have also been produced in gold in various sizes; an almost-hidden Manx cat appears in the background on each of the 1989-onward releases featuring other breeds. A Manx, with a kitten, was the featured cat again in 2012.
             </p>
             <p>
              A Manx cat, in stylized Celtic knotwork art, also appears on the island's 1980-83 penny. The breed figures on numerous Isle of Man postage stamps, including a 2011 series of six that reproduce the art from Victorian era Manx cat postcards, a 1996 one-stamp decorative sheetlet, one stamp in a 1994 tourism 10-stamp booklet, a 1996 five-stamp series of Manx cats around the world, and a 1989 set of the breed in various coat patterns, plus two high-value definitives of 1983 and 1989. The cat appears prominently as the subject of a large number of tourist goods and Manx pride items available on the island and over the Internet, serving (along with the triskelion and the four-horned Manx Loaghtan sheep) as an emblem of the Isle of Man.

              The <strong>Mekong Bobtail</strong>  (formerly known as the Thai Bobtail) is a breed of cat. Originally named for Thailand, the country of origin of its progenitors, the breed is now named after the Mekong River. It is naturally distributed throughout parts of Asia and was developed as a breed in Russia, and it was recognised by the World Cat Federation in 2004.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the 19th century, Mekong Bobtails were among the royal cats given to Russian emperor Nicholas II by Chulalongkorn, king of Siam. The majority of the 200 royal cats gifted by Chulalongkorn had kinked tails resembling those of the modern-day Mekong Bobtail. Other bobtail cats from Southeast Asia were also imported into Russia. The breed is considered to have been developed in Russia, and continued to be experimentally developed there, being bred with other bobtail cats, and possibly also with Siamese cats. The breed started to become more widely known in the 1980s, and in December 1994 a breed standard was drawn up by O. S. Mironova, a Russian felinologist. The breed was recognised by the World Cat Federation in August 2004, and at that time its name was changed from "Thai Bobtail" to "Mekong Bobtail".             </p>

              <p>
                Mekong Bobtails have a glossy, short coat that can be any pointed colour without white markings, and large eyes which the WCF's breed standard terms an "intense blue". The characteristic bobbed, kinked tail contains at least three vertebrae, but must be shorter than a quarter of the body length. The breed has a slight although rectangular build, and the rump is higher than the shoulders. Mekong Bobtails are medium-sized cats, weighing from 8 to 10 pounds (3.6 to 4.5 kg). They have a life expectancy of 15-18 years.
                
              The breed is friendly, affectionate, and active.

              The ancestors of the Mekong Bobtail which were given to Nicholas II were considered royal cats in Siam. They were also thought to be guardians of temples.            </p>

              The <strong>Minskin</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Minskin</strong>  is a breed of cat derived from intentional cross-breeding between the Munchkin and Burmese cat breeds, with the addition of Sphynx and Devon Rex. It is a mostly-hairless or very short-coated dwarf cat breed, with point coloration at the extremities.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707325726/1312/Cats/Minskin/Minskin_Kitten_Female_blue_tabby_color-pattern_gh4iqh.jpg" alt="Minskin" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              In 1998, Paul McSorley began developing the breed in Boston. Paul wanted a breed with the short legs of the Munchkin but a similar appearance to the colour point pattern of the Siamese; however he only wanted fur on the extremities of the cat. To achieve his desired breed he bred the Munchkin with the Sphynx to try and restrict hair to the points. He later added in Devon Rex and Burmese stock into the breed. The first cat that met the desired standard was born in July 2000. By early 2005, roughly 50 cats met the criteria.
            </p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Minskin is notable for it's short stature caused by achondroplasia and the hairlessness or near hairlessness. The head of the Minskin is rounded and wide. The ears have slightly rounded tips. The eyes are large and round, set wide apart. The body is semi-cobby giving it a fubsy appearance.
            </p>
            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>
              The coat of the Minskin is short and the fur-points cover the mask, ears, legs, tail, and scrotum. Fur-points are where the fur is more densely coated compared to other areas where it is sparser such as the torso or temple. The cat may or not may not possess whiskers (vibrissae).
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Due to having the hairlessness of the Sphynx and the dwarfism of the Munchkin, the Minskin is susceptible to several health issues of those breeds. The genetic disorder responsible for the breed's shortened stature can result in an undersized jaw, thick-looking joints, curved spine, and a bow-legged or knock-kneed posture. The shortened legs make the Minskin more susceptible to feline osteoarthritis.

Munchkins have a higher incidence of lordosis and pectus excavatum.

              The <strong>Minuet </strong> (also known as the Napoleon) is a hybrid mix of Persian and Munchkin cat breeds. Categorized by The International Cat Association (TICA) as a domestic hybrid, "developed from a deliberate cross between two existing domestic breeds, incorporating characteristics of both parental breeds into the new mix." The Minuet cat is characterized by its short legs, as a result of the dwarfism-mutation derived from the Munchkin breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to TICA's official standards, these breeds represent the only permissible outcrosses one may use to create the Minuet. This includes the combinations Minuet x Minuet, Minuet x Munchkin, and Minuet x one of the Persian-type breeds (including Persians, Himalayans and Exotic Shorthairs). Minuets come in both long-haired and short-haired varieties.            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In 1996 Joe Smith started breeding Persians with Munchkins. Joe had previously bred Basset Hounds, a breed with osteochondrodysplasia; similarly Munchkin cats have achondroplasia. He wished to create a breed that would appeal to people irrespective of the size of the limbs (the gene responsible for the shortened limbs is autosomal dominant and lethal in utero when the gene is homozygous: therefore not all Munchkins will be born with the smaller stature). The name Napoleon was chosen due to the belief of Napoleon Bonaparte being short.
              </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707604178/1312/Cats/Minuet/White_Gray_Minuet_Cat_xmrr33.png" alt="Minuet" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 2001, the breed was added to the experimental breeds category of TICA. By 2002, it had achieved registration-only status; by 2011, the breed had achieved preliminary status, and was being shown in TICA cat shows by 2012. In January 2015, TICA's board of directors voted to change the name of the breed to Minuet. The breed was promoted to full TICA championship eligibility in 2016. The breed is recognized under the original Napoleon name by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry.            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Minuet has the stubbed legs of the Munchkin and the shortened face of the Persian. The body is semi-cobby with shortened height due to the legs. The tail is not short in comparison to the length of the cat's body. The ears are rounded and wide apart. Eyes are large and round. The Minuet may come in any coat colour.

            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              Due to inheriting both the dwarfism of the Munchkin and the shortened face of the Persian the Minuet is susceptible to multiple health issues relating to both conditions.
             </p>
             <p>
              The condition causing the shortened legs and enlarged head is known as achondrodysplasia and with common symptoms including thick-looking joints, undersized jaw, curved spine, and a bow-legged or knock knee posture. Lordosis and pectus excavatum have higher incidence in breeds with achondrodysplasia. The shortened limbs give the breed a heightened risk of osteoarthritis.
             </p>
             <p>
              The shortened face inherited from the Persian is known as brachycephaly. The anatomical deformities caused by brachycephaly may lead to dyspnoea. Epiphora may occur due to malformation of the nasolacrimal ducts which causes staining and secondary dermatitis. Their shallow eye socket may lead to exophthalmos and feline corneal sequestra. Their malformed jaw can cause difficulty with mastication; the result is a build up of food which leads to accelerated plaque formation and periodontal disease. Brachycephaly may also lead to dystocia with higher rates of still births in brachycephalic cats than cats with mesocephaly. Another condition which occurs due to the anatomical abnormalities is brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome which can cause stridor, sleep apnoea, and even death.

              The <strong>Munchkin </strong>  is a breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. Compared to many other cat breeds, it is a relatively new breed, documented since 1940s and officially recognized in 1991. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1997 with critics voicing concerns over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and uncertainty of the health issues, including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Breeding of Munchkin cats is prohibited by law in several countries due to these genetic health concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name derives from writer L. Frank Baum's diminutive inhabitants of Munchkin Country, originating in the 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.            
            </p>
            <h3>Breed creation</h3>
            <p>
              Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.            </p>
            <p>In 1983, Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in Rayville, Louisiana, found two pregnant cats who had been chased under a truck by a dog. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry's litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance of Monroe, Louisiana, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from Blackberry and Toulouse's litter that today's Munchkin breed is descended.

              <h3>Registry history</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1707949573/1312/Cats/Munchkin/Longhairedmunchkin_xpp7ac.jpg" alt="Munchkin" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by The International Cat Association (TICA) in Davis, Oklahoma. However, the breed would not be officially recognized at that time. Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some dachshunds. For many years, the Munchkin breed was not accepted in feline competitions due to the controversial breeding. Solveig Pflueger, a show judge, geneticist, and chairperson of TICA's Genetics Committee was a strong advocate for the official recognition of the breed. Pflueger was also a breeder of Munchkin cats herself, having been initially sent two cats from Hochenedel. Amidst much controversy, the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by TICA into its new breed development program in September 1994. Veteran show judge Katherine Crawford resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics. The Munchkin breed achieved TICA championship status in May 2003.            </p>

              <p>
                Currently, the only registries that fully recognize the breed are TICA, the Southern Africa Cat Council, the Australian Cat Federation, the World Cat Federation, and Catz Incorporated (New Zealand). There is controversy among breeders of pedigree cats as to what genetic mutations are abnormal and potentially disadvantageous to the cat. Katie Lisnik, director of cat protection and policy at the Humane Society of the United States, has said: "Breeding animals for exaggerated physical characteristics, particularly when it compromises overall health, is irresponsible". Several cat registries do not recognize the Munchkin: Fédération Internationale Féline, which refuses to recognize what they consider a breed based on a "genetic disease". achondroplasia. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy likewise refuses to recognize the breed, considering this breed and others like it to be "unacceptable" because they are based on an "abnormal structure or development". The breed is also not recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association.
              </p>
            <h3>Breeding bans</h3>
            <p>
              Several countries and territories have prohibited breeding with Munchkins, including the Netherlands (2014), which prohibits breeding of all animals with generic defects, and Victoria (Australia). The Australian Capital Territory (a territory of Australia) government considers the Munchkin breed to be "malformed animals" and the deliberate breeding of them "unacceptable" because of the "genetic health problems associated with such breeding".            </p>
            
              <p>
                Munchkin cross-breeds like the bambino have also been subject to legal restrictions.
              </p>
              <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Some sources state that the shortness of their legs does not interfere with their running and leaping abilities, while others state their ability to jump is limited by their condition.            </p>
            <p>The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as outcrosses. It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate body type and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically weigh between 6 and 9 pounds (2.7 and 4.1 kg) and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically weigh between 4 and 8 pounds (1.8 and 3.6 kg). The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly bowed, although excessive bowing is a disqualification in the show ring. Cow-hocked legs are also penalized.            </p>
             <p>The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown in a separate Munchkin Longhair category. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has a semi-long silky coat. TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification. Non-standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown.             </p>
            <p>In 2014, Lilieput, a Munchkin cat from Napa, California, was named the shortest statured living cat in the world by Guinness World Records. She stands 5.25 inches (133 mm) tall.            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              It is not fully known how the mutation impacts the health of the breed. Having only been officially introduced in 1991, the breed is still considered young. There were early speculations that the Munchkin would develop spinal problems commonly seen in short-legged dog breeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The genetic mutation causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins is referred to as achondroplasia, the genetic disorder that results in dwarfism and is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs but can also involve symptoms that include undersized jaw, thick-looking joints, curved spine, and a bow-legged or knock knee posture. The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, there appear to be two conditions with increased incidence in the Munchkin breed: lordosis (excessive curvature of the spine) and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest). Both conditions are commonly seen in humans with pseudoachondroplasia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Munchkin cats are known to be at a higher risk (than other feline breeds) for severe osteoarthritis because the shorter limbs affect their activity levels and behavior. Diagnosis of osteoarthritis and the assessment of its severity for a cat may require radiography.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many pedigree cat associations around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to dwarfism's possible health issues.

            <p>
              The <strong>Nebelung</strong> is a rare pedigree breed of domestic cat. Nebelungs have long bodies, wide-set green eyes, long and dense fur, and mild dispositions. The cat is related to the Russian Blue, but with longer, silkier hair, and is in fact sometimes called the Long-haired Russian Blue.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The American foundation of this cat breed was laid by the cats Siegfried (1984) and Brunhilde (1985). Cora Cobb, the owner of Siegfried and Brunhilde, was very impressed by the beauty of her blue-grey cats. Siegfried and Brunhilde looked like a Russian Blue but with a semi-long coat. To find out if it was possible to start a new breed with these cats, Cora got in touch with the geneticist of the American Cat Association. This geneticist, Solveig Pfleuger, said that the breed was best defined as semi-long haired Russian Blue. Supported by Pfleuger, Cobb wrote the breeding standard according to the Russian Blue, but with a difference: its coat length.             
            </p>
            <p>
              Russian Blue breeders from The International Cat Association (TICA), however, objected to this, and the breed standard was thus revised to describe a unique breed, resembling blue-grey cats that had been imported from Russia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              TICA was the first association to recognize the Nebelung and provides the breed standard. The goal of the Nebelung breeding program is to produce a blue cat with the same type as those early Russian imports and to combine this type with a thick shimmering coat of medium length. The body and tail are long, the ears large in proportion to the head, and the eyes range in color from yellowish green to green. Size is medium and the body well-muscled. The coat is medium long on the body and longer on the tail, with lighter colored guard hairs. The overall appearance is long, sturdy and well muscled. The name Nebelung is derived from the German translation for "creature of the mist" (see Nibelung).
            </p>

              The Nebelung is a rather new breed, with breeders in America, Canada, Russia, and Europe. In addition to TICA, the Nebelung is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA), the World Cat Federation (WCF), Livre Officiel des Origines Félines (LOOF), Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), and independent cat associations in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. The breed's availability is still rather limited.

            </p>

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              Nebelung cats are characterized by a long, graceful neck and body, long legs, long or medium coat, and long tail. Slightly oval eyes are a vivid green color, or sometimes a yellow-green. Large, pointed ears sit atop a modified wedge-shaped head that is more pointed than rounded. The overall appearance is of a long, sturdy, well-muscled cat. The soft double coat feels fine and silky; it is gray in color and is tipped with silver. Males and, to a lesser extent, females have a ruff around the neck. The fur on the tail is longer than that on the body. Tufts of fur are found behind the ears and in between the toes, and the hind legs sport pantaloons. The adult coat reaches its full development when the cat is approximately two years old. The life span of a Nebelung is 16+ years. A Nebelung weighs between 3.5 kg (7.11 lbs) for females and 6.5 kg (14.5 lbs) for sterilized males.

            <h3> Behavioral characteristics </h3>
            <p>
              Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent. The cat's mild-mannered state and personality may not always reflect the relatively high level of intelligence often found in the breed. In spite of the fact that it is an active cat, it can live very well indoors. Nebelungs prefer their own families and often keep a distance from strangers. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and devoted throughout their lives. It is, however, a cat that gladly accepts company of its people or of another cat. Nebelungs are very good communicators and will remind their owners of problems. This happens often since Nebelungs can be very picky about things such as litter cleanliness and food type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many owners of Nebelung cats say that they can act more like dogs at times, being extremely loyal to their owner and family. At times a Nebelung may choose or bond with a specific person within a family group more so than others. They will still enjoy the company of others within the social group but will tend to spend most of their time with said chosen person. They are also known for being easily leash trained with use of a proper harness. It enjoys sitting in a lap and being petted, and will follow its favorite person devotedly from room to room. The breed is also very playful and is known to learn to fetch and retrieve toys when thrown. This is a cat that likes routine, and may require a little time to adjust to changes in the household. Early socialization can help it become more adaptable.

              The <strong>Neva Masquerade
              </strong>  is a breed or sub-breed of long-haired domestic cat, which originates in Russia. It is the sister breed or colourpoint variant of the Siberian cat, a centuries-old Russian landrace. The colourpoint markings are the result of a colourpoint gene originally found in Siamese cats. The Neva Masquerade is believed to be derived from crossing the Siberian cat with Asian colourpoint cats, such as the Siamese or Thai, or possibly cats related to those, such as the colourpointed Persian cats. Some cat registries may classify the Neva Masquerade as a colourpoint variety or sub-breed of the Siberian cat, while others consider it to be a separate sister breed. Regardless of its classification, all Neva Masquerade cats are selectively bred and pedigreed today in all major cat fancier and breeder organisations under the Siberian (Forest) cat or Neva Masquerade. This means that all Neva Masquerade cats are purebred cats with a formally registered ancestry.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612865/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/Gatto_Siberiano_Neva_Masquerade__cropped_yk4yrw.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The colourpoint Neva Masquerade has distinctive blue eyes and dark point markings. It is a medium to large sized, muscular long-hair breed with a bushy tail. Apart from the obvious similarities with the Siberian cat, the cat bears similarities with the Norwegian forest cat, and with other colourpoint long-haired cats, such as the Birman, Himalayan, and Ragdoll. </p>

              <h3>Etymology</h3>
              <p>
                The term Neva Masquerade is derived from Neva, for the river in St. Petersburg, where they are said to have originated.
              </p>
              <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612865/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/Bl%C3%A5tabby_Neva_Masquerade__cropped_d7yvm6.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              References of the ancient Siberian cat breed date back a thousand years, but the colourpoint variety did not appear until the 1970-80s. It is believed that colourpointed cats of Asian origin, or their descendants, were naturally or intentionally crossed into the Siberian breed to achieve the Siamese colourpoint gene.[3][5][6] During the introduction of the Siberian cat to Western European countries and the USA in the late 1980s, the traditional coloured Siberians and colourpointed Neva Masquerade cats were both presented. The Siberian breed was generally recognised in the late 1990s by the cat fancy, however some registries chose to not accept colourpoint varieties in the Siberian breed and made the Neva Masquerade into a separate breed.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612868/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/Neva_jurij_petrowitsch_vom_hohen_timp_esp1li.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Subsequently, the classification of the Neva Masquerade is a highly debated topic under breeders, enthusiasts, organisations, and (inter)national cat registries of the Siberian and Neva Masquerade cat. Some registries such as TICA and CFA accept the Neva Masquerade point colouration as being a natural coat colour within the Siberian cat breed. However, they are classified as a separate breed, the Neva Masquerade, by other registries, such as FIFe, WCF, CCA-AFC, and ACF.
            </p>
            <h3>Colourpoint gene</h3>
            
            <p>
              The Neva Masquerade carries the same colourpoint gene  as the Siamese, which can also be found in other cat breeds related to the Siamese, namely the Birman, Himalayan (colourpoint Persian), Ragdoll and Toybob. This Siamese colourpoint mutation provides the distinctive dark point markings and bright blue eyes in Neva Masquerade cats. The gene pool of the Siberian and the Neva Masquerade share a significant overlap, as the two have been crossbred for many years. Nowadays, commercial tests exists for point mutations, which allows breeders to specifically target carriers of the popular point gene.

            <h3>Differences with Siberian cats</h3>
            <p>
              Although the Neva Masquerade shares many characteristics with the Siberian in terms of character and appearance, recent studies have shown distinctions between the two in terms of body language, vocalisatons, and feline hereditary diseases.
            </p>
            
            <!-- <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612871/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/SIB_Monarch_Lion_s_Heart__5299536566___cropped_oq1omi.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg"> -->
            <p>
              Research on the body language and vocalisation of the two sister breeds showed that Neva Masquerade cats behaved more stressful and fearful in isolation compared to Siberian cats. The vocalisation of Siberian cats is spread over a broader energy spectrum than the Neva Masquerade, which probably results in more diverse sounds in the Siberian cat.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612866/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/Murmur_s_Siberian_Cat_Ermes__cropped_gwrt6i.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a feline heredity disease, which is highly prevalent in the Persian cat gene pool. The heredity disease has not been found in the gene pool of traditional Siberians, however it is diagnosed in a Neva Masquerade male cat. Genetic analysis confirmed the inherited pattern of PKD in its relatives.[6][24] The origin of the Neva Masquerade is unclear, and some believe it is related to the Persian cat, which may explain the prevalence of PKD in this breed. PKD should be considered as a possible cause of chronic renal failure in this breed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) stands as a significant health concern in the feline world particularly in Siberian cats. HCM is characterized by the thickening of the heart's muscle walls which can lead to various complications including heart failure, arterial thromboembolism and sudden death. 
            </p>
            
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712612871/1312/Cats/Neva%20Masquerade/Russia_stamp_2020___2611_olu1r7.jpg" alt="Neva Masquerade" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              These differences between the two sister breeds seem surprising, as they are treated as one breed by many cat enthusiasts and are allowed to be mixed with each other by most breeding registries. Further studies are needed, as these study results are just the beginning of the research on the two sister breeds. Especially, the prevalence of PKD in the Neva Masquerade gene pool is of concern as crossbreeding the two sister breeds could potentially spread PKD into the Siberian breed.

              The <strong>Norwegian Forest</strong> (Norwegian: Norsk skogskatt and Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe. This landrace breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation. The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace breed of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora.
            </p>
            <p>
              During World War II, the Norwegian Forest cat was nearly extinct; then the Norwegian Forest Cat Club's breeding program increased the cat's number. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a cat fancier, Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. The breed is very popular in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, and France.            
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a large breed with a strong body, similar to the Siberian and Maine Coon cat breeds, with long legs, a bushy tail, and a sturdy body. It is very good at climbing, partly because of strong claws.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Norwegian Forest cat is adapted to survive Norway's cold weather. Its ancestors may include cold-adapted black and white British Shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain some time after 1000 AD by the Vikings, and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders around the 14th century. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest breed. The Siberian and the Turkish Angora, longhaired cats from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Norse legends refer to the skogkatt as a "mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage." Since the Norwegian Forest cat is a very adept climber, author Claire Bessant believes that the skogkatt folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern Norwegian Forest breed. The name Norse skogkatt is used by some breeders and fancier organisations for the modern breed.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708739948/1312/Cats/Norwegian/Norwegian_Forest_Cat_face_profile_mozoch.jpg" alt="Norwegian Forest" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Most likely the ancestors of the Norwegian Forest cat served as ships' cats (mousers) on Viking ships. The original landrace lived in the Norwegian forests for many centuries, but were later prised for their hunting skills and were used on Norwegian farms, until they were discovered in the early 20th century by cat enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1938 the first organisation devoted to the breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat Club, was formed in Oslo, Norway. The club's movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing to cross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program. In the 1950s, King Olav V declared them the official cat of Norway. Since the cat did not leave Norway until the 1970s, it was not registered as a breed in the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), the pan-European federation of cat registries, until Carl-Fredrik Nordane, a Norwegian cat fancier, took notice of the breed, and made efforts to register it. The breed was registered in Europe by the 1970s, and in the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1994. In 1978, it was recognised in Sweden as an official breed, and in 1989, they were accepted as a breed in the United Kingdom by the Norwegian Cat Club of Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway and Sweden. Since 2003, it has been the fifth most popular cat breed in France, where there are about 400 to 500 births per year.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708739947/1312/Cats/Norwegian/Ga%C3%AFa__17381345_mzmpzu.jpg" alt="Norwegian Forest" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Norwegian Forest cat is strongly built and larger than an average cat. Adult females weigh 3.6-8 kg (7.9-17.6 lb); males, 4.5-9 kg (9.9-19.8 lb). The breed has a long, sturdy body; long legs; and a bushy tail. The coat consists of a long, thick, glossy, water-repellent top layer and a woolly undercoat and is thickest at the legs, chest, and head. The undercoat appears as a ruff. The profile of the breed is generally straight. Their water-resistant coat with a dense undercoat developed to help the cat survive in the harsh Scandinavian climate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The head is long with an overall shape similar to an equilateral triangle, a strong chin, and a muzzle of medium length; a square or round-shaped head is considered to be a defect. The eyes are almond shaped and oblique, and may be of any colour. The ears are large, wide at the base, and high set, have a tufted top, are placed in the extension of the triangle formed by the head, and end with a tuft of hair like the ears of the lynx.
            </p>
            <p>
              All coat colours and divisions in the traditional, sepia and mink categories are accepted. Since the cats have very strong claws, they are very good climbers, and can even climb rocks.
            </p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              They are friendly, intelligent, and generally good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy. Fanciers note that these cats produce a variety of high-pitched "chirping" vocalisations.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Norwegian Forest cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life.
            </p>
            <p>
              A study comparing Norwegian Forest cat kittens to Siamese, Oriental, and Abyssinian kittens found the Norwegian Forest cat to be more likely to explore and try to escape.

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. Glycogen storage disease type IV due to branching enzyme deficiency was found in an inbred family of Norwegian forest cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.
            </p>

              An analysis of pedigree records of cats in England found evidence of hereditary cardiomyopathy. A study looking at 17 cases of eosinophilic granuloma complex in Norwegian Forest cats found a link between the cats after reviewing pedigree analysis, suggesting a hereditary nature of the condition.

              The <strong>Ocicat</strong> is an all-domestic breed of cat which resembles a wild cat but has no recent wild DNA in its gene pool. It is named for its resemblance to the ocelot. The breed was established from the Siamese and Abyssinian and later on American Shorthair would be added.
               </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Ocicat was created spontaneously by Virginia Daly of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Daly bred a ruddy Abyssinian male named Dalai Deta Tim of Selene to a female seal point Siamese named Dalai Tomboy Patter. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian and a female named Dalai She was kept. Dalai She was later bred to a chocolate point Siamese named Whitehead Elegante Sun. The resulting litter had the desired Abyssinian point Siamese type cats. She continued breeding them but this time one of the kittens was an ivory cat with golden spots. Virginia's daughter said he looked like an ocelot and wished to name him 'ocicat', instead he was named Tonga and was sold off to a medical student for $10 with an agreement to neuter him. Virginia read an article by Dr. Clyde Keeler of Georgia University that described the extinct egyptian spotted fishing cat. Realising Tonga looked similar to the cat she wrote to him about the cat. He replied and suggested that she breed Tonga back with his mother. Given that Tonga couldn't be used she bred his parents together again and this produced a tawny-spotted male named Dalai Dotson. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) made an error when registering the breed and listed it as a mix between the Abyssinian and American Shorthair. This led to the current breed standard where American Shortahr is acceptable and added in more colour variation to the Ocicat. The Ocicat would first be brought to the United Kingdom in 1988 when two cats: Catoninetail Mr Smith and Catoninetail Miss Jones were imported from the United States. Four more would be imported a year later. A total of 33 cats would be imported before 2015. Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese to Abyssinian, and offspring to Siamese. 
            </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708900548/1312/Cats/Ocitat/Topspot_La_Colombina__Liina__OCI_c_24_female_kitten_EX1_pwtam3.jpg" alt="Ocicat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 1966 the breed was recognised with the CFA for registration only. It wouldn't be until more than 20 years later in May of 1987 that the Ocicat would achieve championship status with the CFA. The International Cat Association (TICA) recognised the Ocicat in 1986. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy would give preliminary recognition in June of 1997. In June 2002 it'd be promoted to provisional status and would achieve championship status by 2006.            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Ocicat is a medium to large cat with agouti markings. It has the appearance of an athletic animal: well-muscled and lithe. The muzzle is broad and well defined with gentle curvature of the head. Ears are set around a 45 degree angle. The eyes are large and almond shaped with good spacing so there is more than an eye-width gap between the two. All eye colours are accepted bar blue. Legs are of medium to long length and well muscled with a good proportion to the body. The tail is long, slim with a slight taper and has a dark tip. Adult Ocicats weigh between 6-14 lbs (2.7-6.4 kg)
            </p>
            <h3>Coat colour</h3>
            <p>
              There are 12 recognised colours for the Ocicat: Tawny (black), chocolate, cinnamon, blue (dilute of black), lilac (dilute of chocolate), fawn (dilute of cinnamon), black silver, chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lilac silver, and fawn silver.
            </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the US the Ocicat had a much higher incidence rate than most other breeds with an odds ratio of 16.8. A Swedish study of pyometra in cats based on veterinary and insurance data found the Ocicat to have the third highest incidence of the condition with it being six times the rate for all cats.
             </p>
             <h3>Aztec</h3>
             <p>
              In 2013 the GCCF recognised the Aztec as a separate breed. The Aztec is a mackerel tabby coated version of the Ocicat that would often occur in litters but not meet the standard of the Ocicat as it called for spotted cats only. Aside from the coat it is otherwise identical to the Ocicat. As of 2024 the Aztec has been merged back with the Ocicat and is now the Ocicat Classic, a variant of the Ocicat.

              The <strong>Ojos Azules</strong>  (Spanish: ['oxos a'sules], 'Blue Eyes') was a breed of shorthaired domestic cat with unusual blue or odd eyes caused by a dominant blue eye (DBE) genetic mutation. The breed came in all coat colors, however, only particolors (bicolors and tricolors), colorpoints, and intermediate colors with a characteristic white tail tip were permitted. The breed also had a semi-longhaired coat variety, the Ojos Azules Longhair. Due to the lethal side effects of the Ojos Azules gene, breeders stopped working with this blue eye mutation.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In the 1980s cats with dark blue eyes were discovered among feral cat populations in New Mexico. The first cat with the characteristic, discovered in 1984, was a tortoiseshell named Cornflower. She was bred to males without the trait, which proved to be dominant, as all her kittens showed it. The breed was founded and named Ojos Azules, Spanish for 'Blue Eyes'.            </p>
            <h3>Registration and popularity</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1708899307/1312/Cats/Ojos%20Azules/Lazuli01__cropped_lanum3.jpg" alt="Ojos Azules" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Ojos Azules have always been a very rare breed. In 1992, only ten cats were known. The breed, in both short and long hair variety, was accepted for registration by TICA in 1991. The TICA Ojos Azules Breed Group Standard is dated January 5, 2004. Only cats descending from the original foundation female Cornflower and expressing the deep blue eye gene have been called Ojos Azules. It was discovered that cranial defects may be linked to the gene, and breeding was temporarily suspended. Eventually, breeders stopped working with cats bearing this blue eye mutation and the breed became officially extinct.            </p>

            <h3>Ojos Azules gene</h3>
            <p>
              Ojos Azules were remarkable for their deep blue eyes. The depth of color in the eyes is described as being greater even than that seen in a Siamese and does not cause squinting, deafness or cross-eye. This eye coloration depth in Ojos Azules is due to currently unknown polygenetic variations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Unlike the blue eyes seen linked to the genes in solid white, bicolor, and colorpoint, all of which suppress pigmentation, this gene is not linked to any specific fur color or pattern, giving the opportunity to have cats with dark coats and blue eyes. The blue eye color seen in cats such as the Siamese and the Ojos Azules is due to the same physical phenomenon, the absence of melanin in the iris. Although the cause of the absence of pigment differs between Siamese, white cats, and Ojos Azules, the end result is pigment loss and blue eyes. One indicator of the Ojos Azules gene was a flattened, white tail-tip.
                        </p>
             <p>
              Following a genetic investigation by Solveig Pflueger, breeding resumed in a small way with attempts to breed Ojos Azules without the lethal genetic defects. It was discovered that when the gene is homozygous it caused cranial deformities, white fur, a small curled tail, and stillbirth. However, when the gene was heterozygous, those lethal genetic mutations did not manifest. The result was that breeders crossed the blue-eyed cats with non-blue-eyed cats, assuring a litter of about 50/50 blue/non-blue-eyed kittens.
             </p>           
            <h3>Appearance</h3> 
            <p>
              The medium-sized Ojos Azules was known for its bluish eyes, which were large and round. The neck was arched. The tail was proportionate to the cat's body. The head was somewhat triangular in inscribe. It had a slightly rounded forehead and an angular muzzle. The nose had a slight break. The coat was short, fine, soft, silky, and shiny. The undercoat was not particularly developed, but most were dense in color. All colors were allowed. However, only particolors (bicolors and tricolors), colorpoints, and intermediate colors with a white tail tip were permitted. White markings were common on most extremities (tip of the tail, muzzle, and paws). However, belly spots or chest spots were not acceptable and were considered faults. Solid white coats were not desirable, as they could only be distinguished from common white blue-eyed cats with genetic tests. Solid white blue-eyed Ojos Azules were susceptible to deafness, as is common in white blue-eyed cats without the mutation.
            </p>
            <h3>Revival of dominant blue eyed breeds</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from the extinct Ojos Azules, several other dominant blue eye (DBE) genes have been found in cats worldwide. These are not Ojos Azules, as they are not descending from Cornflower. The cats bear DBE mutations, and are developed into new cat breeds or approved as eye coloration variants in existing breeds by certain cat registries.

              The <strong>Oriental bicolour
              </strong> is any cat of Oriental type, either long-haired or short-haired and in any pattern including colourpoint, which has white areas on its coat caused by the white spotting gene. In most cat fancier and breeder organisations, Oriental bicolours do not constitute a standardised breed, but a coat pattern variant of the breed of their foundation stock. One breed registry is an exception, the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), which has defined them as a separate breed named Oriental Bicolour (capitalised).
             </p>
           
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Although some experimental breeding took place during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, including Pat Turner's Seychellois breeding program, modern-day Oriental bicolours owes their origins to matings initiated in the United States by Lindajean Grillo of Ciara Cattery. Starting in 1979, Grillo carried out a series of matings between Siamese and bicoloured American Shorthair. She then selected the best bicoloured offspring to mate back to Siamese or Orientals in order to regain type. The variety was granted recognition by TICA in 1983 and the first champion was Ciara Quite-N-Oreo.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the 1980s, European breeders, principally those in France and the Netherlands, initiated their own Oriental bicolour breeding lines. A red and white female Moroccan street cat was used as an initial outcross, then later on a Black & White Cornish Rex. Further cats were imported from the USA. It was important for breeders to have different lines in order to be able to mate bicolour to bicolour and obtain a higher proportion of white on the coat, without excessive inbreeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              FIFe granted championship recognition in 2003 to the bicoloured Oriental Shorthairs and in 2005 to the colourpoint and white cats under the breed name Seychellois.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although there was a small breeding program stemming from the last of Pat Turner's cats being kept by Barbara Lambert (Nomis cattery, breeding under FIFe guidelines), this disappeared following her death in the early 2000s. The first modern-day Oriental bicolours were imported to the UK starting in 2004 with the arrival of Black & White male Tassam Tom of Landican owned by Sarah Johnson and Pat Norman of the Landican Cattery. The variety gained official Preliminary recognition with the GCCF in 2006. In 2008 the breed progressed to Provisional Status, the fastest breed recognition within this organisation and a mark of the breed's popularity and success.
            </p>

            <h3>Registration policies</h3>

            <p>
              There are differences in the way that Oriental bicolours are registered in different organisations. Some will register bicoloured Oriental Shorthairs and bicoloured Siamese/Seychellois separately, maintaining a genetic segregation between long and short coats and between colourpoint and solid patterns. This effectively fragments different groups of Oriental bicolour. The GCCF registration policy treats bicolours as a breed, named Oriental Bicolour, and permits all of these related groups to be bred together so that cats carrying the genes for colourpointed long hair are not considered variants. Permitted outcrosses are Siamese, Balinese, Oriental Shorthair, and Oriental Longhair. All offspring are registered as Oriental Bicolours and cannot be registered under the breed of their outcross parent. Offspring who do not inherit white spotting can now be registered as Orientals in the GCCF, according to their phenotype, and can be shown.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              Oriental bicolours are cats of modern Oriental type with a long, slender body and tapering whip-like tail. The triangular shape of the head is made of straight lines with a straight side profile and large, wide-set ears. The eyes are green, except in the colourpoint varieties which have blue eyes. The coat on the short-haired variety is sleek, close-lying and glossy, while that of the long-haired is fine and silky, lying flat to the body with no thick undercoat and forming a plume on the tail. The full range of colours seen in Siamese and Orientals is permitted, however a defining feature of breed is that they always have white spotting. In a cat of show quality this should extend to cover at least one third of the body and the distribution may be random and quirky like splashed paint. There is always a greater distribution of white on the cat's underside and legs in comparison with its back. This patterning is caused by the dominant white spotting gene, which is symbolized with the letter S.

              The <strong>Oriental Longhair</strong> is a variety of domestic cat. It is closely related to the Oriental Shorthair. The Oriental Longhair in some registries, such as The International Cat Association (TICA), is a separate breed. In others, such as the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), it is a division, along with the short-haired variety, of a merged breed, the Oriental. With no globally recognised naming convention, other cat fanciers may refer to this type as Foreign Longhair, Javanese or Mandarin. It was formerly known as the British Angora before being renamed in 2002 by British cat fanciers in order to avoid confusion with the Turkish Angora.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710799491/1312/Cats/Oriental%20longhair/JAV_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4__11319297486___2013__cropped_2023_hccmao.jpg" alt="Oriental Longhair" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Oriental Longhairs feature a long, tubular, Oriental-style body but with a longer silky coat. The range of possible coat colours includes everything from self-coloured (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke (silver undercoat), shaded or tipped, tabby or white. The eyes are almond shaped. The preferred eye colour for Oriental Longhairs is green; except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be odd-eyed (two different coloured eyes).
            </p>
            <p>
              If an Oriental Longhair is bred to an Oriental shorthair or a Siamese, the kittens will all be short-haired. This is because the gene for long hair is recessive. The kittens will, however, be a variant, a carrier of the long-hair gene. If such a "variant" is bred to a cat with long hair, or to another variant, they may produce both short-haired and long-haired kittens. Variants may have a slightly longer coat than Oriental Shorthairs, but this is not always the case.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710799543/1312/Cats/Oriental%20longhair/Oriental_longhair_kitten_zooa3g.jpg" alt="Oriental Longhair" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Oriental Longhair is an active cat that likes to play. If the owner does not have the time to do so, it will often find a toy to play on its own. The breed enjoys jumping and does it well, usually without breaking any objects due to its agility and elegance. Oriental Longhairs are highly intelligent and are ideal companions for people who like their pets to be close to them. They are loyal and most get along well with other cats, especially if they are of the same breed group. Oriental Longhairs are not adapted to a life of living alone and prefer an interactive home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Orientals, like their cousin breed the Siamese, have loud and expressive voices that are used often. Many Orientals take to leash training quickly if started young. They have been known to open cabinets, doors and even refrigerators. This breed group is often recommended for more experienced cat keepers.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The Oriental Longhair typically lives for around 15 years. Some can suffer from flat-chested kitten syndrome, which is a condition where the cat's chest does not develop properly. This can result in breathing difficulties.

              The <strong>Oriental Shorthair</strong>  is a breed of domestic cat that is developed from and closely related to the Siamese cat. It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing fetch. Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. Unlike the breed's blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed. The Oriental Longhair differs only with respect to coat length.

            <p>
              While the breed's genetic roots are ultimately in Thailand, it was formally developed in the US by a number of New York area cat breeders, led by Vicky and Peter Markstein (PetMark cattery), who in 1971-72 were intrigued by lynx patterned and solid colored cats of a Siamese body type at Angela Sayers' Solitaire Cattery and at Patricia White's. These were based on solid-colored cats with the body of a Siamese, bred by Baroness von Ullmann over the 1950s. An "Oriental Shorthairs International" was formed in 1973, and Peter Markstein presented the breed to the 1976 Annual Cat Fanciers Association, at the same time as the Havana Brown was presented by Joe Bittaker. In 1977 the Oriental Shorthair was accepted by the Cat Fanciers' Association for championship competition. Since 1997, it has also received recognition from the GCCF and various other cat breeding organizations. The breed is among the most popular among CFA members.

            <h3>Breed</h3>
            <p>
              The Oriental Shorthair is a member of the Siamese family of breeds, and can be found in various solid colors, and patterns such as smoke, shaded, parti-color/tortoiseshell, tabby and bicolor (any of the above, with white). Not all variants are acceptable to all organizations that recognize the breed.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>

            <p>
              Conforming Oriental Shorthairs, like any of the Siamese type, have almond-shaped eyes and a wedge-shaped head with large ears. Their bodies are typically "sleek" but muscular.

              The long-haired version of the breed, the Oriental Longhair (recognized since 1995 by CFA), simply carries a pair of the recessive long hair genes.

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
              Oriental Shorthair cats have high locomotion levels and are natural conversationalists. The adult Oriental Shorthair cats are considered to be active, curious and interested about surroundings by breeders and veterinarians.
            </p>

            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>
              The Oriental Shorthair is a medium size cat. On average, males weigh from 8-12 pounds (3.6-5.4 kg), with females weighing less than 8 pounds (3.6 kg).

             <h3>History and recognition</h3>
             <p>
              According to the CFA, "Orientals represent a diverse group of cats that have their foundation in the Siamese breed." The Siamese, in both pointed and solid colors, was imported to the UK from Siam (today, Thailand) in the later half of the 1800s, and from there spread widely, becoming one of the most popular breeds. The gene that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as "non-blue eyed Siamese" or "foreign shorthair". Other breeds that were developed from the landrace cats of Thailand include the Havana Brown (which some breed registries classify as simply an Oriental Shorthair variant) and the Korat.
             </p>

             <p>
              The Oriental Shorthair was accepted as an actual breed for championship competition in the US-headquartered CFA in 1977. In 1985, the CFA recognized the bicolor variant. Two decades later, the breed was finally recognized by the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1997, but with some differences from CFA on coat conformation. GCCF publishes separate breed registration policies for a number of specific-coat Oriental Shorthair variants today. The Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF) recognizes the breed, but with color requirements that are comparatively unrestrictive in some way, but notably opposed to white ("All colours and patterns without white and without points are recognized.")
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), some of the point-colored offspring from Oriental Shorthair parents are considered "any other variety" (AOV), but depending on the pedigree, some may compete as Colorpoints. In The International Cat Association (TICA) and many other cat fancier and breeder associations, these cats are considered to be, and compete as, Siamese, when recognized at all.

              The <strong>Persian </strong>  also known as the Persian Longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterised by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however, this has not been proven. Instead, there is stronger evidence for a longhaired cat breed being exported from Afghanistan and Iran from the 19th century onwards. Widely recognised by the North-West European cat fancy since the 19th century,[4] and after World War II by breeders from North America, Australia and New Zealand.[4] Some cat fancier organisations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others generally treat them as separate breeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              The selective breeding carried out by breeders has allowed the development of a wide variety of coat colours,[4] but has also led to the creation of increasingly flat-faced Persian cats. Favoured by fanciers, this head structure can bring with it several health problems. As is the case with the Siamese breed, there have been efforts by some breeders to preserve the older type of cat, the Traditional Persian, which has a more pronounced muzzle. Hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is prevalent in the breed, affecting almost half of the population in some countries.            
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2021, Persian cats were ranked as the fourth-most popular cat breed in the world according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, an American international cat registry.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              It is not clear when long-haired cats first appeared, as there are no known long-haired specimens of the African wildcat, the ancestor of the domestic species.

            </p>
            <p>
              The first documented ancestors of the Persian cat might have been imported from Khorasan, either Eastern Iran or Western Afghanistan, into the Italian Peninsula in 1620 by Pietro Della Valle; and from Damascus, Syria, into France by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc at around the same time. While the de Peiresc import from Syria is corroborated by later correspondences, Della Valle is only known to have voiced his intention in a letter from 1620 but returned to Italy much later in 1626 after travelling several other countries with the remains of his wife in tow and no further mention of the cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              Albeit of unclear geographic faithfulness, the name Persian cat was eventually given to cats imported from Afghanistan, Iran, and likely some adjacent regions for marketing purposes in Europe. Persian-speakers themselves are not documented to refer to any breed of cat as "Persian cat", or gorba-ye pârsi. Instead, variations of gorbe-ye borāq, gorbe-ye barrāq, and gorbe-ye barāq appear in Persian dictionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1839 Lieutenant Irwin notes that “a variety of cat is bred in Cabul, and some parts of Toorkistan. By us it is very improperly called "Persian", for very few are found in Persia, and none exported. The Cabulees call this cat bubuk [buruk?] or boorrak, and they encourage the growth of his long hair by washing it with soap and combing it.”
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712778640/1312/Cats/Persian/Persian_silver_dollface_yowukp.jpg" alt="Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Seeing as the British seemed to assume the majority of Persian cats stemmed from Afghanistan, there is reason to infer that no small portion of the original Persian cat breed stock was, among other places, imported from Afghanistan to Britain and other European countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the Persian cat was not only exported to Europe by this time but also to India. In 1885 Edward Balfour describes the Afghan trade of long-haired cats to India: “The long silky-furred Angora cats are annually brought to India for sale from Afghanistan, with caravans of camels, even so far as Calcutta.”
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Genetic origin</h3>
            
            <p>
              Recent genetic research indicates that present-day Persian cats are related not to cat breeds from the Near East, but to those from Western Europe, with researchers stating that "Even though the early Persian cat may have in fact originated from Persia, the modern Persian cat has lost its phylogeographical signature".[15]
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712778636/1312/Cats/Persian/Persialainen_nofuzb.jpg" alt="Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              This can be seen in the phylogenetic tree of cat breeds and populations. The Persian cat is depicted in red, which indicates it falls genetically in the European cat population. The modern-day Persian cat breed is genetically closest related to the British Shorthair, Chartreux, and American Shorthair.[15] The Exotic Shorthair is a breed developed in the late 1950s by outcrossing Persian cats with American Shorthairs.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Persians and Angoras</h3>
            <p>
              A Persian cat was presented at the first organised cat show, in 1871 in The Crystal Palace in London, England, organized by Harrison Weir. As specimens closer to the later established Persian conformation became the more popular types, attempts were made to differentiate it from the Angora. The first breed standard (then called the points of excellence list) was issued in 1889 by cat show promoter Weir. Weir stated that the Persian differed from the Angora in the tail being longer, hair more full and coarse at the end, and head larger, with less pointed ears. Not all cat fanciers agreed with the idea of making (or creating) a distinction between the two types, and in The Book of the Cat of 1903, Francis Simpson states that "the distinctions, apparently with hardly any difference, between Angoras and Persians are of so fine a nature that I must be pardoned if I ignore the class of cat commonly called Angora".
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712778636/1312/Cats/Persian/Brown_Exotic_Shorthair_Kitten_ttysgo.jpg" alt="Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
                        <p>
                          Bell goes on to detail the differences. Persian coats consist of a woolly undercoat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body." The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora "fails to the Persian in head", Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>Traditional Persian</h3>
                        <p>
                          The traditional Persian, doll-face Persian, or moon-face Persian are somewhat recent names for a variety of the Persian breed, which is essentially the original phenotype of the Persian cat, without the development of extreme features.
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712778636/1312/Cats/Persian/800px-Chocolate_Persian_vzswan.jpg" alt="Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              As many breeders in the United States, Germany, Italy, and other parts of the world started to interpret the Persian standard differently, they developed the flat-nosed "peke-face" or "ultra-type" over time, as the result of two genetic mutations, without changing the name of the breed from "Persian". Some organisations, including the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed. Thus the retronym Traditional Persian was created to refer to the original type, which is still bred, mirroring the renaming of the original-style Siamese cat as the Traditional Siamese or Thai, to distinguish it from the long-faced modern development which has taken over as simply "the Siamese".
            </p>
            <h3>Classification by registries</h3>
            <p>
              The breed standards of various cat fancier organisations may treat the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair (or simply Exotic) as variants of the Persian or as separate breeds. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) treats the Himalayan as a colour-pattern class of both the Persian and the Exotic, which have separate but nearly identical standards (differing in coat length). The Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) entirely subsumes what other registries call the Himalayan as simply among the allowed colouration patterns for the Persian and the Exotic, treated as separate breeds.[40] The International Cat Association (TICA) treats them both as variants of the Persian. The World Cat Federation (WCF) treats the Persian and Exotic Shorthair as separate breeds and subsumes the Himalayan colouration as colourpoint varieties under each.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among regional and national organizations, Feline Federation Europe treats all three as separate breeds.[42] The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) has the three as separate breeds (also with a Non-pointed Himalayan that is similar to the Persian).[43] The Australian Cat Federation (AFC) follows the FIFe practice.[44] The Canadian Cat Association (CCA-AFC) treats the three separately and even has an Exotic Longhair sub-breed of the Exotic and a Non-pointed Himalayan sub-breed of the Himalayan, which differ from the Persian only in having some mixed ancestry.[45] The (UK) Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) does likewise.

            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              In 2008, the Persian was the most popular breed of pedigree cats in the United States. In the UK (GCCF), registration numbers have dwindled since the early 1990s and the Persian lost its top spot to the British Shorthair in 2001. As of 2012, it was the 6th most popular breed, behind the British Shorthair, Ragdoll, Siamese, Maine Coon and Burmese. In France, the Persian is the only breed whose registration declined between 2003 and 2007, dropping by more than a quarter.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most colour popular varieties, according to CFA registration data, are seal point, blue point, flame point and tortie point Himalayan, followed by black-white, shaded silvers and calico.
            </p>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              The Persian is generally described as a quiet cat. Typically placid, it adapts quite well to apartment life. Himalayans tend to be more active due to the influence of Siamese traits. In a study comparing cat owners' perceptions of their cats, Persians rated higher than non-pedigree cats on closeness and affection to owners, friendliness towards strangers, cleanliness, predictability, vocalization, and fussiness over food.
            </p>
            <h3>Ultra-type consequences</h3>
            <p>
              The modern-type brachycephalic Persian has a large rounded skull and shortened face and nose. This facial conformation makes the breed prone to breathing difficulties, skin and eye problems, and birthing difficulties. Anatomical abnormalities associated with brachycephalic breeds can cause shortness of breath. Persians are susceptible to malocclusion (incorrect bite), which can affect their ability to grasp, hold and chew food.[52] Even without the condition, the flat face of the Persian can make picking up food difficult, so much so that specially shaped kibble has been created by pet food companies to cater to the Persian. Malformed tear ducts cause epiphora, an overflow of tears onto the face, which is common but primarily cosmetic. Entropion, the inward folding of the eyelids, causes the eyelashes to rub against the cornea and can lead to tearing, pain, infection and cornea damage. This condition is not uncommon in Persians and usually involves the medial aspect of the lower eyelid.[54][page needed] Similarly, in upper-eyelid trichiasis or nasal-fold trichiasis, eyelashes/hair from the eyelid and hair from the nose fold near the eye grow in a way that rubs against the cornea.[55] The anatomical changes in the upper respiratory track caused by brachycephaly such as stenotic nares, elongated soft palate, and nasopharyngeal turbinates contribute to obstruction of the airways and breathing difficulties.[56] Due to the reduction of the maxillary alveolar space the Persian's teeth are positioned at abnormal angles and overlap, causing dental and gingival problems.[57] Brachcephaly causes the Persian to have shallow orbits and protuding eyes, this can lead to keratitis, sequestrum developments in the cornea, and non-healing corneal ulcers.[58][59][60] The reduction of the length of the maxilla can cause excessive skin folds on the face, which may lead to the development of idiopathic facial dermatitis. The brachcephalic skull of the Persian has led to changes in the morphology of the cranial cavity, causing intracranial overcrowding, herniation of the brain, and hydrocephaly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dystocia, an abnormal or difficult labour, is relatively common in Persians. Consequently, the stillbirth rate is higher than normal, ranging from 16.1% to 22.1%, and one 1973 study puts the kitten mortality rate (including stillborns) at 29.2%. A veterinary study in 2010 documented the serious health problems caused by the brachycephalic head.
            </p>
            <h3>Life span</h3>
            <p>
              Pet insurance data from Sweden puts the median lifespan of cats from the Persian group (Persians, Chinchilla, Himalayan and Exotic) at just above 12.5 years, while most cats live until they are about 15 years old. 76% of this group lived for 10 years or more and 52% lived for 12.5 years or more. Veterinary clinic data from England shows an average lifespan of 14.1.
            </p>
            <h3>Internal medical conditions</h3>
            <p>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) which causes kidney failure in affected adult cats has an incidence rate of 36-49% in the Persian breed. A study in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 46% of tested Persian cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Previous ultrasonographic studies (involving procedures likely to be performed on cats suspected of kidney problems) found a PKD rate in Persian and related breeds of 49.2% in the UK, 43% in Australia, and 41.8% in France. The breed - and derived ones, like the British Longhair and Himalayan - are especially prone to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).[71] Cysts develop and grow in the kidney over time, replacing kidney tissues and enlarging the kidney. Kidney failure develops later in life, at an average age of 7 years old (ranging from 3 to 10 years old). Symptoms include excessive drinking and urination, reduced appetite, weight loss, and depression.[72] The disease is autosomal dominant and DNA screening is the preferred method of eliminating the gene in the breed. Because of DNA testing, most responsible Persian breeders now have cats that no longer carry the PKD gene, hence their offspring also do not have the gene. Before DNA screening was available, an ultrasound was done. However, an ultrasound is only as good as the day that it is done, and many cats that were thought to be clear, were in fact, a carrier of the PKD gene. Only DNA screening and breeding cats that are negative for the PKD gene will produce kittens that are also negative for the gene, effectively removing this gene from the breeding pool.[73]

            </p>
            <p>
              Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common heart disease in all cats. It is likely hereditary in the Persians. The disease causes thickening of the left heart chamber, which can, in some instances, lead to sudden death. It tends to affect males and mid- to old-aged individuals. The reported incidence rate in Persians is 6.5%.[74] Unlike PKD, which can be detected even in very young cats, heart tests for HCM have to be done regularly to effectively track and/or remove affected individuals and their offspring from the breeding pool.
            </p>

            <p>
              Early onset progressive retinal atrophy is a degenerative eye disease, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in the Persian.[76] Despite a belief among some breeders that the disease is limited to chocolate and Himalayan lines, there is no apparent link between coat colour in Persians and the development of PRA. Basal-cell carcinoma is a skin cancer which shows most commonly as a growth on the head, back or upper chest. While often benign, rare cases of malignancy tend to occur in Persians. Blue smoke Persians are predisposed to Chédiak-Higashi syndrome. White cats, including white Persians, are prone to deafness, especially those with blue eyes.
            </p>
            <h3>Grooming</h3>
            <p>
              Since Persian cats have long, dense fur that they cannot effectively keep clean, they need regular grooming to prevent matting. To keep their fur in its best condition, they must be brushed frequently. An alternative is to shave the coat. Their eyes may require regular cleaning to prevent crust buildup and tear staining.

              The <strong>Traditional Persian
              </strong>  is one of several names for a group of cats that are considered to be essentially the original breed of Persian cat, before the variety was selectively bred to have extreme features. Other everyday usage names are: Doll Face Persian, Classic Persian, Old Fashioned Persian, Long-nosed Persian, Old-style Longhair, Traditional Longhair and Original Longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The physical appearance of this domestic cat breed barely changed when compared to photos dating back to the late 1800s. However, since some breeders in the United States and other parts of the world introduced the brachycephalic mutation into the breed, the short nose and clear break became shorter and higher. This resulted in the modification of the original Persian breed standard so that modern show quality Persians must have pushed-in faces. This resulted in the breed disappearing from cat shows.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this older form of Persian cat was made iconic to the general public through its use in popular films, even as it was being phased out in the cat fancy. For example, the Traditional Persian has been featured in eight of the James Bond movies, beginning with "From Russia with Love" in 1963. It was also featured in the kung fu cult classic Enter the Dragon.

            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              Persian cats originate from Persia (Iran). The cats were introduced in Europe in the 1500s as highly valued items of trade. The Europeans were impressed by the Persian's long, silky coat and purposefully bred the cats to perpetuate the trait.
            </p>
            <h3>Brachycephalic mutation</h3>
            
            <p>
              The brachycephalic mutation in the Persian breed occurred during World War II in the US. This led to a concerted effort to breed Persians with rounder heads and smaller ears than their ancient ancestors after World War II. The resultant brachycephalic heads lead to the much desired snub noses favored by many modern Persian breeders and which dictates the modern standard for Persians in cat fancies throughout the world.

            <h3>Chinchilla color mutation</h3>
            
            <p>
              The color inhibitor gene mutated in a Persian cross in 1882 in the UK in a cat called "Chinnie". The offspring of this mutation that express the gene are commonly known as "chinchillas" presumably due to the resemblance of their coat to that of the rodent by that name. They were classified as a Persian variety for breeding purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The chinchilla comes in both the silver and golden series, with black silver chinchilla as the most common. Chinchilla cats are almost pure white Persian cats with a sprinkling of darker colored tipping (shell) that gives them a sparkling metallic appearance. The chinchilla should have only a tiny amount of darker colored tipping on their face and legs. Only the hair tips are darker pigmented (approx. 1/8 of the hair length), and chinchillas are significantly lighter in overall color compared to Persians with shaded coats (approx. 1/3 of the hair length is darker pigmented).
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712860892/1312/Cats/Traditional%20Persian/Cat_Show_-_Ft._Lauderdale_-_October_2008_a5upkc.jpg" alt="Traditional Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <h3>Color breeding in chinchilla varieties</h3>
            <p>
              The sub-set of chinchilla varieties experienced problems during the brachycephalic modernization phase with regards to the original chinchilla coloring features. These included loss or incomplete lip- and nose liners; patched-colored paw pads and eye color faults. Once lost, it is hard, if not impossible, to recover.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the mid-1950s, concerned breeders of chinchilla in the US advocated pure color breeding. A key person in this regard was Jeanne Ramsdale, author of the book "Persian Cats and Other Longhairs".

            <h3>Sterling standard</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712860899/1312/Cats/Traditional%20Persian/Persian_in_Cat_Cafe_1_zdeqkm.jpg" alt="Traditional Persian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <p>
              There is some confusion around the name "Sterling". In the International Cat Association (TICA),[5] there were some American Shorthair breeders who bred to Persians to obtain their lovely silver color and green eyes. The kittens were pretty to look at but did not meet the true American Shorthair type. Jane Martinke noticed the effect the outcrosses had on the American type and coat as well as the attractiveness of the kittens. She proposed a new breed, called the "Sterling"[5] because of their lovely silver color. These new cats were to look just like Persians but with a short, dense plush coat. The name was changed to "Exotic Shorthair" when all colors got accepted in 1979.
            </p>
            <p>
              In September 1992 the "English Sterling" as a New Breed was presented by Jeanne Johnson at the TICA 13th Annual Meeting. Follow-up work resulted in the breed with the name "Sterling" (without 'English' in front) was accepted as Category 1 in TICA in Feb 1994. (Category 1 in TICA means "Established Breeds".) The Sterling had Category 1 status only for 18 months, before it was scrapped in total by TICA in September 1995. The assumed reason is that there was a lack of buy-in from enough fellow breeders as required by TICA breed recognition rules. Despite this set-back, Jeannie Johnson continued by getting the "Sterling" accepted by the International Cat Exhibitors (ICE) for championship status in 1998. The breed had its own registry under the International Sterling Society. However, not many breeders of chinchilla Persian elected to switch over from the existing Persian standard to the new Sterling standard. Mrs Johnson died in 2006 before she could get wider buy-in for the breed. Due to lack of support, this Sterling breed does not exist anymore.
            </p>
            <h3>Chinchilla Longhair standard</h3>
            <p>
              In South Africa, all breeds cat judge and Chinchilla breeder Stella Slabber, headed up a project to separate the breed from the modern Persian standard. This standard was only to be applicable to color-bred silvers, commonly known as "Chinchillas" in South Africa. The breed was accepted under the name "Chinchilla Longhair" with breed code "CHL" in the SA Cat Council (SACC) in 1996.

              The <strong>Peterbald</strong> is a hairless cat breed of Russian origin. It was created in St. Petersburg in 1994 from an experimental cross of a Don Sphynx and an Oriental Shorthair. They have an Oriental build with a dominant hair-losing gene. The breed was accepted for Championship status in 2009.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Peterbald breed was born during the latter half of 1994 in St. Petersburg, Russia, the result of an experimental mating of a Don Sphynx (also known as Don Hairless, Donskoy or Donsky) male named Afinogen Myth and an Oriental Shorthair female World Champion named Radma von Jagerhov, by Russian felinologist Olga S. Mironova. The first two litters produced four Peterbald kittens: Mandarin iz Murino, Muscat iz Murino, Nezhenka iz Murino and Nocturne iz Murino. These four Peterbalds were the foundation stock of the breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1996, the breed was adopted in the Russian Selectional Feline Federation (SFF) and given a standard and an abbreviation (PBD). In 1997 it was adopted in The International Cat Association (TICA) with the abbreviation PD, and in 2003 in the World Cat Federation (WCF) with the abbreviation PBD. Other used handles of the breed are PTB, PD and PSX.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days the breed develops in the direction of modern Oriental and Siamese body-types, that is to say a long muzzle, large set-apart ears, flat cheekbones, and an elegant body on long legs. Therefore, all standards for this breed encourage mating with Oriental and Siamese cats and semi-longhair variations of those (such as Balinese and Javanese). The Balinese and Javanese were eliminated from the acceptable outcross list in 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Peterbald was accepted for Championship class competition, effective May 1, 2009, in the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) in August 2008. Effective May 2008, TICA recognises the "brush coat" Peterbald for Championship competition.
            </p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711733366/1312/Cats/Peterbald/Tamila_the_lilac_tabby_Peterbald_cat_cryvh1.jpg" alt="Peterbald" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            
            <p>
              Peterbalds resemble Oriental Shorthairs in body-type. They have a dominant hair-losing gene inherited from the Don Sphynx, and can be born bald, flocked, velour, brush, or with a straight coat. Those born with hair, excepting the straight-coats, can lose their hair over time. They come in all colours and markings.

              Members of the breed have a slim and muscular build. They have a narrow and long head with a straight profile, almond-shaped eyes, wedge-shaped muzzle, and large, set-apart ears. They have a long whip-like tail, webbed feet and oval paws that allow them to grasp objects and open levered doorknobs.           
             </p>
             <h3>Behavior</h3>
             <p>
              Peterbalds are sweet-tempered, affectionate, peaceful, curious, smart, and energetic. They are medium vocal and tend to follow their owners and want to be with them. Peterbalds typically live in harmony with other cats and pets, and also with children.
             </p>
             <h3>Breeding ban</h3>
             <p>
              Since 2014, it is illegal in the Netherlands to breed with parent cats which bear genetic mutations or other physical abnormalities that cause health or welfare issues in their offspring. The lack of protecting fur in hairless cats, such as the Peterbald, is one of these banned mutations in parent cats.

              The <strong>Pixie-bob
              </strong> is a breed of domestic cat claimed to be the progeny of naturally occurring bobcat hybrids. However, DNA testing has failed to detect bobcat marker genes, and Pixie-bobs are considered wholly domestic for the purposes of ownership, cat fancy registration, and import and export. They were, however, selected and bred to look like American bobcats.
            </p>
   
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In the spring of 1985, Carol Ann Brewer purchased near Mount Baker, Washington, a unique male cat with a spotted coat, a short tail, and polydactyl paws. In January 1986, she rescued another male cat named Keba, which was very large, had a bobbed tail, and was reported to have been sired by a bobcat. While this cat was starving, it still weighed 17 pounds, and was so tall it reached up to Brewer's knees. Shortly after she had acquired this large male, it mated with a next door neighbor's brown spotted female cat. In April 1986, a litter was born from this mating. Brewer eventually kept one of the female kittens, named "Pixie", and after a year started a breeding program with Pixie as the foundation cat.             
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next couple of years, Brewer introduced into her program 23 cats from around the nearby Cascade Range, that were believed by her to be born from naturally occurring matings between bobcats and domestic cats. She coined the term "Legend Cat" to refer to such cats and has since registered a trademark in the U.S. to limit the term to describe permitted outcrosses used in her breeding program. At the same time, other breeders in the U.S. were working with distinctly wild looking barn cats and collaborated with Brewer to establish a broad genetic base and to develop the foundation of today's Pixie-bob.
            </p>
            <p>
              Led by Brewer, they succeeded in registering their new breed with The International Cat Association (TICA) and eventually the American Cat Fancier's Association (ACFA). The Pixie-bob was accepted into the "Exhibition" category by TICA in 1993, promoted to "New Breed and Color" status in 1996 and eventually gained Championship status in 1998. The Pixie-bob was classified by TICA initially as a "Native New Breed", defined as "A new breed which has been identified through selection of phenotypically similar individuals from a naturally occurring population indigenous to a particular geographic region" but it is now classified as an established breed.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711489287/1312/Cats/Pixie-bob/P-b_facial_features_nzlznu.jpg" alt="Pixie-bob" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Frank Ditto attempted to patent the Pixie-bob in 1999, but his application was rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Successive litigation upheld the rejection.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed standard</h3>
            
            <p>
              Pixie-bobs are a fully-domesticated, selectively-bred breed of cat (Felis cattus) intended to resemble the North American bobcat (Lynx rufus).
            </p>
            <p>
              While the average domestic cat breed weighs about 8 lb (4 kg), Pixie-bobs can be somewhat larger, but (on average) usually do not exceed 11 lb (5 kg), similar to a medium- to large-sized domestic cat. Only very few breeders are regularly producing larger cats, which are generally large-boned, muscular and massive in form. Male Pixie-bobs are, most times, larger than females. Pixie-bobs grow for up to four years, instead of one year, like most domestic breeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most Pixie-bobs have black fur and skin on the bottom of their paws, with tipped ears, heavy ear-hair, black lips, and white fur around the eyes (but with black eye-skin). Their muzzle is large, with rounded whisker pads and a red nose-leather. Their chins have white fur, but often have black skin underwear. Some of their whiskers change from black (root – about 25%) to white (to the tip – about 75% of the whisker). Their bobcat-like fur pattern often has reddish, apricot, and peach tones mixed-in. Most are short-haired, but some are long-haired. The brow should be heavy and the eyes should have a triangular shape. Eyes are blue when kittens, then change to green or gold when several months old. Tail size can range from 2 inches (approximately 5 cm) to hock length when leg is extended. The head is pear-shaped and is considered to be the most important characteristic.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711489287/1312/Cats/Pixie-bob/Jarnac_Bepacific_feb07_ia9xp5.jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              It is not presently known what genetic similarity there may be (or not) between the Pixie-bob and other breeds with suppressed tails, such as the Manx, American Bobtail, and Japanese Bobtail.
            </p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
              Pixie-bobs are said to be highly intelligent, social, active, bold, and enjoy playing with other animals. They are also known for their "chirps", chatters, and growls; most meow scarcely if at all.

              Most Pixie-bobs are highly sociable around both their owners and strangers. Almost all Pixie-bobs like to be in the same room as their owners, and will follow them around the house.
                        </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              As the breed is frequently outcrossed to "legend cats", Pixie-bobs are genetically diverse and are not prone to problems caused by inbreeding. Pixie-bob breeders use a disease database, Pawpeds, to ensure that health information can be recorded and monitored.

              The <strong>Ragamuffin </strong>  is a breed of domestic cat. It was once considered to be a variant of the Ragdoll cat but was established as a separate breed in 1994. Ragamuffins are notable for their friendly personalities and thick fur.
            </p>
          <h3>General description</h3>
          <p>
            The physical traits of the breed include a rectangular, broad-chested body with shoulders supporting a short neck. These cats are classified as having heavy bones and a "substantial" body type.
          </p>
          <p>
            The head is a broad, modified wedge with a moderately rounded forehead with short or medium-short muzzle and an obvious nose dip. The muzzle is wide with puffy whisker pads. The body should appear rectangular with a broad chest and broad shoulders and moderately heavy muscling in the hindquarters, with the hindquarters being equally broad as the shoulders. A tendency toward a fatty pad in the lower abdomen is expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fur length is to be slightly longer around the neck and outer edges of the face, resulting in the appearance of a ruff. Texture is to be soft, dense and silky. Ragamuffin kittens are usually born white and develop a color pattern as they mature. Every color and pattern is allowable, with or without white. Their coats can be solid color, stripes, spots or patches of white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, seal brown or mixed colors. Their eyes can be any solid color, with some exhibiting heterochromia.

            <p>
              The IRCA Cherubim Cats developed from 1971-1994 (23 years) were used as the foundation cats for the Ragamuffin breed and included the IRCA Miracle Ragdolls, Ragdolls, Honey Bears, and Maxamillion lines.

              In contrast, their cousin the Ragdoll breed was founded with only the IRCA Ragdoll lines developed from 1971-1975 (4 years).
              
              Currently, acceptable outcrossings are as follows: ACFA (Siberian), CFA (Long Haired Selkirk Rex, Straight), GCCF (British Longhair).             
            </p>

            <p>
              Ragamuffins originated from the Ragdoll breed in the 1960s by Ann Baker in California. Originally one of the characteristics of the Ragdoll was its tendency to be limp and comfortable when handled, and it was from these characteristics that it got its name. A group of Ragdoll breeders aspired to create a breed that would keep the positive features of the Ragdoll while allowing for more breeding freedom. This breed was created in an effort to achieve this purpose. Thus, the Ragamuffin breed came into existence with its nature along with a wide range of colors and patterns. Today these cats bring charm and love to households worldwide as a combination.            
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1975, after a group of IRCA Ragdoll breeders left, Baker decided to spurn traditional cat breeding associations. She trademarked the name "Ragdoll" and “Cherubim” and set up her own registry, International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA). Baker imposed stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The IRCA Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered in other breed associations.
            </p>

            <h3>Breed divergence</h3>
            <p>
              In 1994, a group of IRCA breeders decided to leave and form their own group because of the increasing restrictions. Owing to Baker's trademark on the name Ragdoll and Cherubim, the group renamed its stock of IRCA Cherubim Cats Ragamuffins. While the originally proposed name was Liebling, the name Ragamuffin was put forth as an alternative by Curt Gehm, one of the group's founders, and it was chosen.
            </p>
             <p>
              In the spirit of improving the breed's genetic health, personality, and temperament, the group selectively allowed a limited amount of outcross to Domestic Longhair cats that appeared to already fit the Standard of Perfection established in ACFA. Later, once the Domestic Longhair Cat allowance expired, outcrosses allowed historically include Persians. The group also allowed some limited outcrossing to IRCA Ragdolls initially (ended in 2010 for ACFA-recognized Ragamuffins). Only cats with at least one Ragamuffin parent and an accepted outcross in ACFA/CFA/GCCF currently qualify to be called Authentic Ragamuffins. (Cat Fanciers' Association, American Cat Fanciers Association, Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.)
             </p>
             <p>
              The first cat association to accept the breed at full show champion status was the United Feline Organization (UFO), and shortly that same year it was accepted into the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). Finally, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) accepted them into the Miscellaneous class in February 2003 and advanced them to Championship class in February 2011.
             </p>
             <p>
              The most obvious difference between typical Ragamuffins and Ragdolls is the required point coloration in Ragdolls, where as the Ragamuffin is allowed any color and pattern. The Standard of Perfection describes the Ragamuffin as requiring a 'sweet' overall expression with large, rounded with pinch at the corner, walnut-shaped eyes versus the Ragdoll's thinner, slightly angled almond-shaped eyes. Adding to the sweet expression, Ragamuffins have rounded contours between the ears and a nose scoop versus the Ragdoll which calls for flat planes. Ragamuffins call for a flatter topline and Ragdolls call for a more angular topline with the raised hind quarter. Ragamuffin coats are to be plush in texture and the Ragdoll allows for both silky or plush coats.

              The <strong>Ragdoll</strong> is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name 'Ragdoll' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ragdolls are often known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like cats", due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ragdolls are distinguishable by their pointed coloration (where the body is lighter than the face, ears, legs, and tail), large round blue eyes, soft, thick coats, thick limbs, long tails, and soft bodies. Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was developed in Riverside, California, by breeder Ann Baker. A regular, non-pedigreed, white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats.[4] Josephine was not of any particular breed, nor were the males who sired the original litters. Ann Baker herself said that the original cats of the Ragdoll breed were "alley cats". Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all-black male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown/black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were daughters of Josephine. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker's cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat breeding associations. She trademarked the name Ragdoll, set up her own registry - the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) - around 1971, and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered by other breed associations.[9][10] The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite small, particularly since Baker's death in 1997.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA to gain mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the CFA and the FIFe.[11] Around the time of the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported to the UK. Eight more cats followed this pair to fully establish the breed in the UK, where the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy recognizes it.
            </p>
            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712923085/1312/Cats/Ragdoll/A_breed_of_cat_with_a_distinct_colorpoint_coat_and_blue_eyes._xjsz5v.jpg" alt="Ragdoll" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and calm nature, with claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation or merely an instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens by their mother.[13][14][15] The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are pain resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility 'might not be in the best interests of the cat'.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Breed standard marketing and publicity material describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent, relaxed in temperament, gentle, and an easy-to-handle lap cat. The animals are often known as 'puppy cats', 'dog-like cats', 'cat-dogs', etc., because of their placid nature and affectionate behavior, with the cats often following owners from room to room as well as seeking physical affection akin to certain dog breeds. Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and enjoy doing so. They have a very playful nature that often lasts well into their senior years. Unlike many other breeds, Ragdolls prefer staying low to the ground rather than the highest point in the household.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds. Fully-grown females weigh from 8 to 15 pounds (3.6 to 6.8 kg). Males are substantially larger, ranging from 12 to 20 pounds (5.4 to 9.1 kg) or more. It can take up to four years for a Ragdoll to reach mature size. They have a sturdy body, bulky frame, and proportionate legs. Their heads are broad with a flat top and wide space between the ears. They have long, muscular bodies with broad chests and short necks. Their tails are bushy and long in length, their paws are large, round, and tufted, and their coats are silky, dense, and medium to long length. Due to their coats tending to be long, they usually require brushing at least twice a week. Adults develop knickerbockers on their hind legs and a ruff around their necks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed is often known for its large round deep blue eyes, though other cats may have that feature as well. The genes for point coloration are also responsible for these distinctive blue eyes. More intense shades of blue are favored in cat shows.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1712923086/1312/Cats/Ragdoll/Pansy_cat_xtqjhg.jpg" alt="Ragdoll" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association, in 'reduced shedding and matting'. But there may be a noticeable increase of shedding in the spring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ragdolls come in six distinct colors: seal, chocolate, red, and the corresponding 'dilutes': blue, lilac, and cream. There also are the lynx and tortoiseshell variations in all colors and the three patterns. Ragdoll kittens are born white: they have good color at 8-10 weeks and full color and coat at 3-4 years.
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              One study, utilizing Swedish insurance data, showed that of the common cat breeds, the Ragdoll and Siamese have the lowest survival rate, with a 78% chance of survival to 10 years. An English study of patient records found a life expectancy of 10.1 years. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Ragdoll was over-represented, with an odds ratio of 5.14.[36] An English study reviewing over 190,000 patient records found the Ragdoll to be less likely to acquire diabetes mellitus than mixed breed cats. The prevalence in Ragdolls was 0.24% compared to 0.58% overall.

            <h3>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy            </h3>
             <p>
              Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common heart disease in all cats and is most commonly genetic in cause. The disease causes thickening of the cardiac wall, which makes the heart pump blood less efficiently. It can, in some instances, lead to sudden death. In Ragdolls that are homozygous positive for the disease (having two copies of the HCM gene), the condition can present early (as young as six months) and tends to be severe, with most cats dying by age 3. Heterozygous (one copy of HCM gene) cats tend to have later onset and slower progression of the disease, with less severe impact.
             </p>
             <p>
              A DNA test was developed in 2007 to identify the gene that causes HCM in Ragdolls. Breeding only from Ragdolls that are free from this gene (homozygous negative) will ensure that they will not develop the form of HCM associated with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The allelic frequencies of the Ragdoll HCM mutation R820W were 0.17 in cats from Italy and 0.23 in cats from the US in 2013. This reference states that the R820W prevalence is 30% in UK. The HCM prevalence was found to be 2.9% (95% CI = 2.7-8.6%) in this study.

              The <strong>Raas </strong> (also known as Madurese cat) is an endemic breed of domestic cat from Raas Island in Indonesia. Raas is a pure cat breed without mixed genes from other cat breeds. It is a rare breed and has high genetic variation. As of 2016, it is estimated that there are less than 100 Busok Raas with pure genes remaining.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Busok Raas cat has four color variations - blue, black, chocolate and lilac. The breed is registered with the World Cat Federation (WCF), with standards for its characteristic short, curved tail.
            </p>
            <p>
              The development of the breed only occurs on Raas Island. It is protected by the local residents, who forbid the cats from leaving the island. Usually only neutered Busok Raas cats are allowed to be taken off the island so that the purity of the breed is maintained. The birth of blue kittens is always eagerly awaited by the local residents. These kittens will later be given to certain people as gifts, such as cat lovers.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The origin of the Busok Raas is unknown. It is most likely that the breed evolved naturally on the island. It is likely to be an Asian cat because of the shape of its tail which is bent at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information regarding the existence of domestic cats has attracted the attention of several cat lover clubs in Indonesia. The cat club wants the preservation of the Busok Raas cat to be maintained and for this cat to be recognized in the international cat community. Unfortunately, their breeding is deemed difficult due to local community beliefs that Busok Raas cats were only kept by nobles and ulemas. However, several Busok Raas cats have been taken outside of Madura and can be found in Bandung, Bogor, and one in Semarang.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1709400465/1312/Cats/Raas/Lilac_kecilku_fhbmm5.jpg" alt="Raas" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Busok Raas has similar physical characteristics to leopards and jungle cats. They have a graceful appearance and are medium in size but larger than other cat breeds. Their face is triangular and slightly square with a slightly sharp chin. Their ears stand straight forward, and are long and pointed. They have a long tail with most of the tip bent. Eyes are dark green  and usually blue in cats with dark brown with an oval shape and not too wide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their fur is short, fine and soft in solid patterns two colors, and color dots, in blue (grey) and cinnamon (dark brown). The blue color can be present in a solid and two-color pattern with blue fur found on most of the body and white on the chest and stomach with unclear boundaries. Meanwhile, cinnamon color can be present in a solid pattern or color dots. Cats with a blue color are known as Busok cat, while those with a cinnamon color are known as Amethyst cat. The amethyst cat is the type that appear most rarely and is classified as a recessive color. However new black and lilac variations have emerged.

            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
              Wild Busok Raas cats are afraid of humans and are difficult to adapt to. The Busok Raas cat has a more family-friendly character after breeding and refining until the 4th generation (F4). This cat really appreciates those who care for it. They are quiet, very shy and guarded, but over time, once they are used to their new environment they adapt and become very friendly. Some become spoiled house cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              The weaning period of kittens is marked very clearly, and at the age of 3 months he will do so until he is able to give birth a maximum of three times in one year. In certain situations, it is best to breed them when their body condition returns, looking muscular and fat so that during the next pregnancy the kittens and mother will be in prime condition.

              The <strong>Russian Blue</strong> (Russian: Русская голубая кошка, romanized: Russkaya golubaya koshka), commonly referred to as just Russian Blue, is a cat breed with colors that vary from a light shimmering silver to a darker, slate grey. The short, dense coat, which stands out from the body, has been the breed's hallmark for more than a century.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
              The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangelsk in Russia. They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues. It is believed that sailors took them from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s. The first reference to an Archangel Cat appears in British print in 1862. The first recorded appearance of one in a show was in 1872 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat.  However, Harrison Weir writing in 1895 reported that the early show cats under the Russian Blue name were British-bred grey tabbies, with separate grey cats arriving from Archangel in Britain in the 1800s with features consistent with the modern breed.  The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912, when it was given its own class. The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right after the war, a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese. Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war, it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today. American breeders combined the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues. The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out. The short hair and slate-gray/blue color is often seen in mixed-breed cats, which can affect breeders and showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Russian Blues are plush short-haired, shimmering pale blue-gray cats with emerald green eyes or yellow eyes. Guard hairs are distinctly silver-tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance. They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung. They are being used in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in FIFe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were created from crosses with domestic white cats which were allegedly imported from Russia. The first line was developed by Frances McLeod (Arctic) in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis Jones (Myemgay) in Australia in the 1970s. By the late 1970s, the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in the United Kingdom as Russian cats (in different classes). However, the Cat Fanciers' Association and FIFe does not recognize any variation of the Russian Blue.

              The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, pinkish lavender or mauve paws, two layers of short thick fur, and a blue-grey-black coat. The color is a bluish-gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene. However, as dilute genes are recessive ("d") and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes ("dd") two non-Color-Point Carrier (non-CPC) Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat. Due to the breeding with Siamese after World War II, there are color-point genes floating around. If two carriers are bred together, then they will produce a litter of mixed colors—solid blue or white with blue-point like a Siamese. People call these CPC cats "color-point", "whites" or "pointed" Russians. In most registries, one cannot register, breed or show a color-point Russian. These color-point (blue-point) cats are called Color-Point-Russian Blue (Blue Point Russian Blue) or more informally as Pika Blu (or pika blue) cats and have the same general characteristics as the Russian Blue cats.            
            </p>

            <p>
              The coat is known as a "double coat", with the undercoat being soft, downy and equal in length to the guard hairs, which are an even blue with silver tips. However, the tail may have a few very dull, almost unnoticeable stripes. The coat is described as thick, plush and soft to the touch and can be described as being softer than the softest silk. The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance. Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green. Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats. Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues (which are not a distinct breed, but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns), nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats, although they have similar traits.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions. They are normally reserved around strangers, unless they are brought up in an active household. Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks. They can also be fierce hunters, often catching rodents, birds, rabbits, small mammals, or reptiles. As loving and easy going as Russian Blues are, they do not like change, and prefer predictable, routine schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Russian Blue kittens are energetic and require adequate playmates or toys as they can become mischievous if bored. They have exceptional athleticism and rival even Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb. Slow to mature, Russian Blues retain many of their adolescent traits both good and otherwise until they are 3-4 years old and even much older Blues can be easily enticed into play by their owners. Russian Blues are also highly intelligent. They have an excellent memory and will learn the hiding place of favorite toys and lead their owners to them when they want a game. They also have a keen ability to remember favorite visitors and will race to greet familiar faces even if quite some time has passed between visits.
            </p>

            <h3>Growth and maturity</h3>
            <p>
              They are small to moderate-sized cats with an average weight of 3.6 to 6.8 kg (8 to 15 lb) when fully grown. Males will typically be larger than females. Their gestation period is approximately 64 days.
            </p>

            <h3>Allergies</h3>
            <p>
              Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies. There is speculation that the Russian Blue produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1, one source of cat allergies. The thicker coat may also trap more of the allergens closer to the cat's skin. Glycoprotein is one source of cat allergies, but this does not mean that all allergies will be stopped. They can still happen, but not as extreme, and for a much less amount of time than other cat breeds. Because of this, Russian Blues are very popular with people with allergies all around the world.

              The <strong>Savannah </strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Scottish Fold</strong> is a distinctive breed of domestic cat characterised by a natural dominant gene mutation associated with osteochondrodysplasia. This genetic anomaly affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the head. While this trait contributes to the breed's unique appearance, often described as "owl-like", it has negative effects on the cats' welfare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.            </p>
            <p>
              All Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia, a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed and studies point to all Fold cats being affected by it. Fold cats therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe painful degenerative joint diseases at an early age. Due to these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited in several countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat breed.
            </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Tayside, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. The breeding programme produced 76 kittens in the first three years - 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene.Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. However by the early 1970s the GCCF stopped registering the cat due to concerns about potential health issues such as ear infections and deafness. In 1970 the first Scottish Fold kittens were introduced to America via a Dr. Neil Todd of Massachusetts who was researching the mutation. Further cats were brought over and the Scottish Fold breeding program continued with American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs being introduced.
            </p>
            <h3>Acceptance</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711538586/1312/Cats/Scottish%20Fold/1024px-Straight-eared_Scottish_Fold_ecgph5.jpg" alt="Scottish Fold" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Legal bans on the breeding and sometimes sale of Folds have been enacted in several countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland, due to the breed's health issues, especially deformities and pain caused by osteochondrodysplasia, which results in abnormalities in bone and cartilage throughout the body. Some of the major cat registries, such as the GCCF and FIFe, do not recognise, nor allow for the registry and competition showing of, Scottish folds.

            </p>
            <h3>Legal bans</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the prevalence of osteochondrodysplasia in the breed (see below), several countries and states have prohibited breeding with Scottish folds, in order to protect animal welfare. Banning countries include the Netherlands in 2014, Austria in 2020, Flanders (Belgium) in 2021, Victoria (Australia), Norway in 2023, The breed is also indirectly banned by Swedish legislation prohibiting the breeding of animals with genetic make up that makes it likely to produce unhealthy offspring. Some countries have also banned selling of Scottish fold cats, or the breeding with any cat that bears the gene mutation resulting in osteochondrodysplasia, so even breeding with some of the Scottish straights may be legally restricted. Potential parent cats can be tested for this mutation before breeding.

            <h3>Registry bans</h3>
            <p>
              Because of its health problems, the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe). GCCF withdrew registrations in 1971 due to crippling deformity of the limbs and tail in some cats and concerns about genetic difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness, but the Folds were exported to the Americas and the breed continued to be established, using outcrossing with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Since the initial concerns were brought, the Fold breed has not had the mite and infection problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cat Fanciers' Association breeders have stated that using only fold to non-fold breeding has eliminated problems with stiff tails, shortened tails, and bone lesions. In the FIFe discussion, the representative for British breeders claimed that they were not seeing the problem in their cats, and that the study which showed that all heterozygous also have the condition had a small sample size. An offer of free X-ray radiography was presented to 300 breeders to find a Fold cat with healthy hind legs, but it was never taken up. A similar offer was set up by the World Cat Federation together with researcher Leslie Lyons but there was also no response. FIFe stated that they will not consider recognizing Scottish Folds if breeders will not allow their breed to be scrutinized.
            </p>
            <h3>Popularity</h3>
            <p>
              Despite warnings from organisation such as GCCF ("we strongly advise members of the public not to try to acquire cats of this breed"), the distinctive physical traits of the Scottish Fold, combined with their reputation as unusually loving companions, make Folds highly sought-after pets, with Fold kittens typically costing considerably more than kittens of more common breeds. Scottish folds are also popular among celebrities, one of them being American singer Taylor Swift, who owns two Scottish fold cats named Meredith Grey (after the titular character of the medical drama series Grey's Anatomy), and Olivia Benson (after the protagonist of the police drama series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit).
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The medical problem most associated with the breed is osteochondrodysplasia, which leads painful malformed bones and joint diseases, especially when both parents were of the folded-ear form, as covered in detail below.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is prevalent in the Scottish Fold. A study in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 54% of tested Scottish Fold cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for PKD.

A study in Japan found two genes linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Scottish Fold population.

            <h3>The Cat Who Went to Paris</h3>
            <p>
              The short novel The Cat Who Went to Paris by Peter Gethers features "the most famous Scottish Fold" according to Grace Sutton of The Cat Fanciers' Association. The book - and the two that followed - document the life of Gethers and his Fold, Norton, from their first meeting to Norton's eventual death and Gethers' experiences after the loss.

              The <strong>Selkirk Rex
              </strong>  is a breed of cat with highly curled hair.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              The Selkirk Rex is distinct from all other Rex breeds. Unlike the Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, the hair is of normal length and not partly missing. There are longhair and shorthair varieties. It differs from the LaPerm in that the Selkirk Rex coat is plusher and thicker. While the LaPerm gene is a simple dominant, the Selkirk gene (Se) acts as an incomplete dominant; incompletely dominant allele pairs produce three possible genotypes and phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710103349/1312/Cats/Selkirk/PolloSelkirkRex_wg2b5s.jpg" alt="Selkirk Rex" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The Selkirk Rex originated in Montana, USA in 1987, with a litter born to a rescued cat. The only unusually coated kitten in the litter was ultimately placed with breeder, Jeri Newman, who named her Miss DiPesto (after a curly-haired character in the TV series Moonlighting played by Allyce Beasley). This foundation cat was bred to a black Persian tomcat, producing three Selkirk Rex and three straight-haired kittens. This demonstrated that the gene had an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. All Selkirk Rex trace their ancestry back to the cat Miss DiPesto. Jeri Newman named the breed after her stepfather, "Selkirk," making this the first (and currently only) breed of cat to be named after an actual person.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed has been developed in two coat lengths, long and short. It is a large and solidly built breed, similar to a British Shorthair. The coat is very soft and has a woolly look and feel with loose, unstructured curls. The head is round, with large rounded eyes, medium-sized ears, and a distinct muzzle, whose length is equal to half its width. An extreme break, like that of a Persian, is a disqualifiable fault.
            </p>
            <p>
              American Shorthairs, Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs, and British Shorthairs have been used as outcrosses to develop this breed. The American Shorthair has now been discontinued as an outcross, except in The International Cat Association (TICA). The breed was accepted by The International Cat Association in 1992, the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1998, and the Cat Fanciers' Association in 2000. In Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and in Australia, all outcrosses are scheduled to be discontinued in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed is accepted in all colors, including the pointed, sepia, and mink varieties of albinism; bicolors; cinnamon; silver/smoke; and the chocolate and lilac series. This breed has an extremely dense coat and high propensity for shedding. Unlike other Rex breeds with reduced amounts of hair, the Selkirk Rex is not recommended for those who might be allergic to cat allergens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The temperament of the Selkirk Rex reflects that of the breeds used in its development. They have a lot of the laid-back, reserved qualities of the British Shorthair, the cuddly nature of the Persian, and the playfulness of the Exotic Shorthair.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no known health problems specific to the Selkirk Rex breed. They are a robust breed. Breeding towards proper head structure is necessary to prevent kinking of the tear ducts, resulting in tear run down the front of the face, or muzzle creases that can result in dermatitis on the face. Like other Rex breeds, irritation of the inside of the ear by curly fur can occur, increasing the production of ear wax. Homozygous cats (with two copies of the dominant Selkirk Rex gene) may have a tendency towards excessive greasiness of the coat, requiring increased frequency of bathing. Other health problems may be inherited from the outcross breeds used, including polycystic kidney disease from Persians and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from British Shorthairs. Responsible breeders screen their breeding cats for these diseases to minimize their impact on the breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the UK, all Selkirk Rex registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) for breeding are genetically tested for Polycystic Kidney Disease or are from two genetically tested parents.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Selkirk Rex is defined by an autosomal dominant woolly rexoid hair (ADWH) abnormality that is characterized by tightly curled hair shafts. A splice variant in the gene KRT71 was found to be associated with the curly coat phenotype. KRT71 is a crucial gene for keratinization of the hair follicle. An allele of this gene is also responsible for the hairless (hr) Sphynx and the Devon Rex (re) hair. Three mutations in KRT71 have now been identified in cats, forming the allelic series, KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr, where SADRE is the suggested locus designation for the Selkirk autosomal dominant rex 21 allele.

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Singapura </strong>  is the smallest breed of cat, noted for its large eyes and ears, ticked coat, and blunt tail. Reportedly established from three "drain cats" imported from Singapore in the 1970s, it was later revealed that the cats were originally sent to Singapore from the United States before being exported back to the US. Investigations by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) concluded that no wrongdoing had occurred and the Singapura kept its status as a natural breed.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In 1975, after working in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow returned to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats. These three cats, a pair of male and female kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Singapura was accepted for registration by the TICA in 1979 for championship competition and by CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. During this period, breeders found that the occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the recessive gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the recessive gene. It was discovered that two of the three foundation cats carried this gene.
            </p>
            <h3>Controversy</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711230715/1312/Cats/Singapura/4Singapura_thjteg.jpg" alt="Singapura" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 1987, while on a cat finding trip to Singapore, American breeder Jerry Mayes discovered importation papers which revealed that the three foundation cats were actually taken into Singapore from the US in 1974. Lucy Koh, a friend of Mayes, made efforts to correct the history of the Singapura presented by the Meadows but that went relatively unnoticed until 1990, when the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (currently Singapore Tourism Board) started a campaign to use the Singapura as a national mascot. Reporter Sandra Davie was informed of the discrepancy and published an article about it in the national broadsheet The Straits Times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the cats were registered as Abyssinians in the import certificates, and because the Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, as well as the Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CFA investigated the incident at the request of a Singapura breed club. In the investigation, Hal Meadow told the investigation board that the three cats were grandchildren of four local cats he sent back to the US during a previous sensitive business trip to Singapore in 1971, contradicting the Meadows' earlier claim of the foundation cats' origin. Apparently Tommy Meadow lied about it to conceal the secret trip. The CFA found no wrongdoing and kept the Singapura's status as a natural breed. CFA's Joan Miller said that "Whether they mated on the streets of Singapore or whether they mated in Michigan, it doesn't really matter." Referring to the cat picked up from the SPCA in 1981, she said that "In addition, there is at least one documented cat that is behind many Singapura pedigrees and it was picked up at the pound. Even with none of the cats the Meadows brought in we still have a legitimate cat from Singapore behind our Singapuras."
            </p>
            <p>
              Recent studies in 2007 based on feline DNA showed that there are very few genetic differences between the Singapura and Burmese, adding support to the claim that the Singapura is not a natural breed.
            </p>

            <h3>Singapuras in Singapore</h3>
            <p>
              The Singapore Tourist and Promotion Board (STPB) proceeded with the decision to use the breed (advertised under the name Kucinta) as a tourism mascot after CFA concluded its investigation. The name Kucinta is an amalgamation of the Malay words kucing (cat) and cinta (love) and taken from the winning entry in a naming competition. Incidentally, Kucinta also means "The one I love" in Malay. Sculptures of the Singapura can be found by the Singapore River.
            </p>
            <p>
              While in Singapore brown moggies with ticked coats can occasionally be seen, few if any resemble the Singapura, with the majority of cats being bobtailed tabbies, tortoiseshells or bicolor, and the move by the STPB is seen by locals to be an advertising move based on the popularity of the breed among tourists at that time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2004, the Singapore Zoo hosted a temporary exhibit of Singapura cats in celebration of the nation's 39th National Day. Four Singapura cats were loaned by their owners for the event.

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Singapura is moderately stocky and muscular with a very short and fine coat. The world's smallest cat breed, a full-grown female usually weighs 1.8 kilograms (4.0 lb) while the male weighs 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb). The large, slightly pointed, and deep cupped ears together with the large almond-shaped eyes are characteristics of the breed. The tail is slender, slightly shorter than the length of the body and has a blunt tip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breed's coat pattern is that of a ticked tabby. That is, individual hair strands have alternating sections of dark and light color, typically two dark bands separated by two light bands, with a dark color at the tip. The underside, including the chest, muzzle and chin, takes the color of the light bands. The Singapura is recognized by cat registries in only one color, the sepia agouti, described as "dark brown ticking on a warm old ivory ground color".
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Of concern to breeders is the condition known as uterine inertia, an inability to expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present in one of the foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries to be made by Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice. A test is available that can determine whether a cat is affected, a carrier, or clear of the disease. Singapuras with PKD can usually live a normal life.
            </p>
             <p>
              Some breeders have shown concern regarding the lack of genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA study found that the Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen have to meet certain health and appearance requirements.

              The <strong>Snowshoe </strong>  is a rare breed of domestic cat originating in the United States of America in the 1960s. The Snowshoe is a short-haired bicolour colourpoint breed. Snowshoes were first produced when a Siamese breeder's cat gave birth to three kittens with white feet. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, then began a breeding program to produce what were originally called "Silver Laces", crossing the strangely marked Siamese cats with bicolour American Shorthair cats and other breeds. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing the correct coat markings.
            </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              In the 1960s, a cat owned by Siamese cat breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty produced a litter of Siamese kittens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Three of the kittens had unique markings, consisting of white points and feet. Intrigued by their looks, she began working to breed cats like them, using seal point Siamese with bicolour American Shorthairs. The offspring of those cats lacked the Siamese points, but by breeding the offspring to Siamese cats, the desired look was accomplished. Hinds-Daugherty named the breed "Snowshoe" because of their white feet. Hinds-Daugherty promoted the Snowshoe at local cats shows, though they were not recognised at the time. Hinds-Daughtery eventually abandoned the Snowshoe breeding program, and it was taken up by Vikki Olander.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711228165/1312/Cats/Snowshoe/FionaSnowshoe_ltvulm.jpg" alt="Snowshoe" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Olander wrote the first breed standard for the Snowshoe, and succeeded in obtaining the Cat Fanciers Federation (CFF) and the American Cat Association's (ACA) "experimental breed" status for the Snowshoe in 1974. However, by 1977, Olander was the last breeder of the Snowshoe in the United States. After struggling to keep the breed alive, Olander was contacted by Jim Hoffman and Georgia Kuhnell, who were interested in the breed. Other breeders joined Olander, Hoffman, and Kuhnell, and they obtained the champion status from the CFF in 1983. In 1989, Olander left the program, as her fiancé was allergic to cats. However, by then the Snowshoe had a strong following, and the breed attained champion status with the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) in 1990 and was recognised by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1993. Currently, breeders work to attain acceptance with the Cat Fanciers Association, but struggle with the lack of cats and breeders needed for the association's requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Snowshoes are also fully recognised by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), and the Cat Fanciers Federation.

            <p>
              The Snowshoe is a rare breed, partly due to the difficulty of breeding cats with markings and patterns that conform well to breed standards. The Snowshoe's pattern relies on recessive genes and other factors to produce desired results. One gene, which causes the "V" facial pattern is an example of incomplete dominance. If the offspring produced has two dominant genes for the marking, then the feature will be larger than a cat with one dominant gene. However, other factors may influence the feature, which makes it difficult to predict the outcome, Another issue is the white boots, which can be caused by a piebalding gene or a gloving gene. The genes are difficult to control, and many cats' boots extend too far up the leg, do not reach far enough up the leg, or the cat completely lacks white. As such, pet-quality Snowshoes usually have too much white, too little white, or white features are mismarked. The cats' body type further complicates breeding, as the breeder must achieve the correct head shape and ear set, while still maintaining the body structure of the American Shorthair and the length of the Siamese.

            <h3>Anatomy</h3>
            <p>
              The ear size ranges from medium to medium-large with slightly rounded tips. The head may be triangular, however can be an "applehead" shape with a traditional cat look. The short-haired coat consists of solid and white patterns. Points (ears, tail, face-mask and sometimes legs) are solid black-based colours. White patterns vary, typically falling along the face, chest, stomach, and paws. The body is an even colouration, subtle shading to point colour on back, shoulders and hips; toning to a lighter shade near chest and stomach. Paw pads may be white, point colour, flesh tone, or mottled. Their colour will darken with age, even to the point of turning a chocolate brown shade. The eyes are always blue. The tail is medium-sized. Snowshoe cats come in blue, lilac, lynx, fawn, chocolate, and seal points. The Snowshoe is a medium-large cat and its body longer than other cat breeds, with many males reaching 6 kg (14 lbs) or more.

            <h3>Coat</h3>
            <p>
              In registries and cat associations, the recognised Snowshoe coat colour is point colouration, with a light body colour and darker ears, face, legs, and tail. The ACFA recognises seal (black) and blue point colouration, while the FIFe recognises seal (black), blue, chocolate, red, cream, cinnamon, and fawn point colouration. Additionally, the FIFe recognises the colours in tortoiseshell, tabby, and tortoiseshell-tabby coat patterns. TICA recognises all pointed colours. Snowshoe kittens are born white, and markings appear within 1 to 3 weeks. Each Snowshoe has a pattern unique to the individual cat.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Snowshoe's coat should be of medium to short in length, and should be bright and smooth with no noticeable undercoat. It is considered a fault within cat associations if the Snowshoe has a plush or double coat. The Snowshoe's coat undergoes seasonal changes and does not require much grooming.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality</h3>
            <p>
              Snowshoes are generally affectionate, sweet-tempered, and mellow. They enjoy the company of humans and being given attention, and are compatible with children and other pets. Snowshoes are very social and docile, and show great devotion and love towards their owners. Consequently, the cats of this breed dislike being left alone for long periods of time and are able to cope with working hours better if they have another cat companion. The cats are also noted as being intelligent; they can learn to open various types of doors, and can be taught tricks, especially fetch. Snowshoes also enjoy water, particularly running water, and may on occasion swim.

              The <strong>Sokoke</strong>(or Sokoke Forest Cat in long form, and formerly the African Shorthair) is natural breed of domestic cat, developed and standardised, beginning in the late 1970s, from the feral khadzonzo landrace of eastern, coastal Kenya. The Sokoke is recognized by four major cat pedigree registry organizations as a standardised cat breed.[1][verification needed][2] It is named after the Arabuko Sokoke National Forest, the environment from which the foundation stock was obtained, for breed development primarily in Denmark and the United States. The cat is long-legged, with short, coarse hair, and typically a tabby coat, though specific lineages have produced different appearances. Although once rumored to be a domestic x wildcat hybrid, genetic study has not borne out this belief. Another idea, that the variety is unusually ancient, remains unproven either way. The native population is closely related to an island-dwelling group, the Lamu cat, further north.
             </p>
            <h3>Original khadzonzo landrace</h3>
            <p>
              Coastal Kenya's distinctive, free-roaming, feral cats - known as khadzonzo or kadzonzo, and found from city streets to the Arabuko Sokoke national forest - were "discovered", in the Western cat fancy sense, by horse breeder and wildlife artist Jeni Slater in 1978 near Watamu coconut plantation,[3] though of course the cats were known for much longer by native people. By that point, the rural population were thought to be nearly extinct due to human encroachment on the forest and its resources.[4] Although there were ideas that it might be a new subspecies of wildcat, the tameness of the kittens Slater reared suggested that theoretical hybridisation with wildcats was unlikely, as did features like the long, tapered tail (not characteristic of any wild African species), a general form consistent with Asian domestic cat breeds (very unlike the cobby figure of wildcats), and the mottled, blotched coat pattern (a characteristic of urban cat populations). The feral khadzonzo were developed into a standardised breed, the Sokoke, which has a much more uniform appearance than the landrace cats.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              The forest population tend to consistently "breed true" for ticked coats in brown tones with prominent mottling with large rosette spots, which may fuse. They share this general feature with many other forest-dwelling felids, a natural form of camouflage. Aside from specific patterns, the cats in this population do not seem vary widely in appearance. The town-dwelling population (presumably through crossbreeding with non-native cats) come in a wider variety of colours and patterns, including white-spotted coats, and some that are mostly black.[3] The urban variety are very similar to an island population a few hundred kilometres north, the subject of a book called The Cats of Lamu (by Jack Couffer, 1998, Lyons Press). All of these populations are characterized by narrow faces compared to other African domestic cats, as well as long ears, long legs, and a lean, not cobby, body.
            </p>

            <h3>Relation to other populations</h3>
            <p>
              Couffer hypothesises that, due to their isolation and Lamu's ancient history as a trade centre between Africa and Asia, they may be more closely related than even the Egyptian Mau breed to the original cats domesticated in the Fertile Crescent over 4,000 years ago and holding special favour in Ancient Egypt
            </p>
            <p>
              While modern genetic work has yet to prove or disprove Couffer's idea, a DNA study by the Cat Genome Project (CGP) at the US National Cancer Institute has determined that the spotted khadzonzo street cats of eastern Kenya, the cats of the Lamu Archipelago off the Kenyan coast, and the standardized Sokoke are all closely related. CGP categorised them in its "Arabian Sea Racial Group" (among a total of 12 feline "race" groupings).[8] The group's shared DNA is derived primarily from Asian domestic cats, with ancient Arabian wildcat progenitors.[citation needed] This dispels the suspicion of some breeders that the cats are at least part modern wildcat - they are no more wild than the rest of the domestic cats. Advances in DNA sequencing have now resulted in an ambitious whole-body sequencing effort, called the 99 Cat Genome Project, which may reveal much more about the origins of the khadzonzo and connections that it and the Sokoke has with other cat populations.
            </p>
            <h3>Status</h3>
            <p>
              The Lamu population are under pressure from a sterilisation campaign championed by recent immigrants,[6] while the forest population have become rare for unclear reasons, and more secretive.[3] Eight specimens (only two female) were captured for breeding from the forest in 2001; photographs show that several have very large dark blotches, somewhat reminiscent of the unrelated clouded leopard species (a trait now available in recent bloodlines of the pet breed), but share both tall ears and long body with the already-established formal breed.[3] As with most native landrace populations of cats, these must be under threat of genetic erosion from modern cats introduced, and allowed to roam and interbreed, by foreign settlers to the area. For example, the Manx cat is nearly extinct in its homeland, the Isle of Man, being bred out by the imported cats of British and other immigrants, though the standardised form developed from the landrace is common and popular around the world. Similar threats to the Van cat have impelled the Turkish government to hastily set up an official breeding programme to save it in a more pure form than the weakly related Turkish Van and Turkish Angora standardised breeds which bear little resemblance to the landrace feral populations of Van city and the Lake Van area.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Sokoke is a "natural breed", i.e., one developed and standardised from the local, free-breeding landrace population, and thus distinct from it by virtue of careful selective breeding for specific, fixed traits believed to epitomise the distinctions evolved by natural selection in the original population. As British cat geneticist and pedigree judge Pat Turner wrote in 1993, in the early days of recognition of the breed's standardisation, the fixing of traits like large "wild-looking" spots that are distinct from other blotched breeds "can only be done by selective breeding".
            </p>
            <p>
              The breeding programme was begun in 1978 by Jeni Slater, who originally named the breed the African Shorthair. She used cats found in and around Watamu, both raised from kittenhood and enticed from the adult feral population with food rewards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gloria Moeldrop, a friend of Slater's, brought a pair of Slater's cats home with her to Denmark to breed in 1983,[3] because Slater feared for the survival of the native cat in Kenya.[9] The cats were first shown in Copenhagen in 1984, then in Odense. Slater introduced a darker Watamu street cat specimen into the breeding programme, in 1987, for genetic diversity. Breeder and North American Sokoke Association officer Pat Longley has suggested that this cat introduced the lynx point pattern seen in some Sokokes. In 1989, Moeldrop imported more cats from Kenya to strengthen her European breeding stock. Slater also provided at least one to a breeder named Bob Schwartz, in Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jeannie Knocker, an Englishwoman residing near Slater in Kenya,[when?] gathered several feral cats near the borders of the forest and kept them penned, producing litters that were exported to the US and Europe, registered to establish future pedigrees, and bred; these became known as the "new line" Sokoke cats, with distinctive features from those of the Slater-developed "old line". The cats caught in the forest from 2001 onward have been added to this breeding programme, as have some more recent specimens.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              The standardised breed was first recognised by a breed registry, the Belgium-based Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), under the name Sokoke, after the forest. This occurred in 1993, after a multi-breeder demonstration of the new breed's consistent development at a cat show in Denmark.

The breed is also registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), based in the United States; it is eligible to be shown in the "Preliminary New Breed" class at TICA-sanctioned events.

The Sokoke is now also recognised by two national cat registries, the UK Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), and the Canadian Cat Association (CCA).
            </p>
            <h3>Breeding</h3>
            <p>
              It is typical for the male to help raise the kittens, getting in the nest box with them. If left together, the mother will often wait months to wean her kittens, even though their development is fairly rapid once they leave the nest box.[14] Breeders expect one to two litters per year, per breeding pair. Sometimes two litters may come closely in a row, with a longer period of time before further reproduction. Sexual maturity is usually reached at around eight to ten months of age.

              The <strong>Somali </strong> cat is genetically similar to the Abyssinian cat. Due to inheriting 2 copies of the recessive gene for long hair, they have a characteristic luscious coat, unlike their cousin the Abyssinian.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710536969/1312/Cats/Somali/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0_gy6emd.jpg" alt="Somali" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              In the 1940s, a British breeder named Janet Robertson exported some Abyssinian kittens to Australia, New Zealand and North America. Descendants of these cats occasionally produced kittens with long or fuzzy coats. In 1963, Mary Mailing, a breeder from Canada, entered one into a local pet show. Ken McGill, the show's judge, asked for one for breeding purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first known long-haired Abyssinian, named 'Raby Chuffa of Selene', appeared in North America in 1953. Breeders assume that the long-haired gene was passed down through his ancestry. Most breeders were appalled by the sudden difference in appearance in their litters and refused to mention them. However, some breeders were intrigued and continued to breed the long-haired Abyssinian. At first, other Abyssinian breeders looked down upon the new development of the Somali and refused to associate them with the Abyssinian. They worked hard to keep the long-haired gene out of their own cats.
            </p>
            <p>
              An American Abyssinian breeder Evelyn Mague also received longhairs from her cats, which she named "Somalis". Mague put out a call for other cats to breed with her own long-haired Abyssinians and found the many other breeders internationally that had been breeding long-haired Abyssinians for several years already. Don Richings, another Canadian breeder, used kittens from McGill, and began to work with Mague. The first Somali recognized as such by a fancier organization was Mayling Tutsuta, one of McGill's cats. In 1979, the breed was recognized by the CFA in North America. The new breed was accepted in Europe in 1982. By 1991, the breed was broadly (though not universally) accepted internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The name "Somali" is in reference to the African nation, Somalia. Somalia borders Abyssinia, which is modern day Ethiopia. The name of the breed is a unique interpretation of the Ethiopian-Somali conflict; Mague charitably assumed that since the land borders were a human creation, so are the genetic borders between the Abyssinian cat and the long-haired Abyssinian.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mague also founded the Somali Cat Club of America, which included members from Canada as well. The SCCA worked to grant the breed championship status by the CFA, which occurred in 1979. In 1975, the CFA founded the International Somali Cat Club.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            
            <p>
              Somalis are recognised for their energetic and social nature. Their appearance with sleek bodies, long tails, and large pointed ears have earned them the nickname of "Fox Cat." Their ticked coats contain between four and twenty colours on each hair are very fine in texture making their coats softer to the touch than those of other cat breeds. The cat itself is medium-large in size. Within the GCCF, short haired Somalis are recognised separately from Abyssinian cats.            
            </p>
            <h3>Colours and patterns</h3>
            <p>
              All Somali cats have a ticked tabby pattern. The usual or ruddy coloured Somali has a golden brown ground colour ticked with black, so the official genetic term is black ticked tabby. The coat colour names in Somalis refer to the ticking colour. There are 28 colours of Somali in total although certain organisations accept only some of these colours. All organisations that register Somalis permit usual (genetically black, a.k.a. ruddy or tawny in Somalis), blue, sorrel (genetically cinnamon, a.k.a. red in Somalis), and fawn. Most clubs also recognise usual/ruddy silver, blue silver, sorrel/red silver, and fawn silver. Other colours that may be accepted by some registries include chocolate, lilac, red, cream, usual-tortie, blue-tortie, sorrel-tortie, fawn-tortie, chocolate-tortie, lilac-tortie, and silver variants of these (e.g. blue-tortie silver).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710536969/1312/Cats/Somali/800px-Cat_Somali_gaqiin.jpg" alt="Somali" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The Somali cat is usually healthy, with few breed-related health issues, though some problems may occur. These include gingivitis, tooth decay, and renal amyloidosis, which are also seen in many other breeds of cats. Renal amyloidosis (often called RA) is a condition in which there is a deposition of the protein amyloid in various tissues which hinders that part of the body's normal functioning. Other problems that are prevalent in most cat breeds, the Somali included, are feline infectious anemia (FIA) and autoimmune-mediated hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Some AIHA-related diseases are inherited erythrocyte disorders, such as pyruvate kinase deficiency and osmotic fragility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently found in cats has been myelodysplasia. It is normally known to affect humans but was recently found in a litter of Somali kittens. Like AIHA, myelodysplasia causes anemia and is speculated to be the cause of anemia in Somalis in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Somalis may also have hereditary retinal degeneration due to a mutation in the rdAc allele. This mutation is also seen in Abyssinians, Siamese cats, and other related breeds.

              The <strong>Sphynx </strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.

              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>

              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Suphalak</strong> (Thai: แมวศุภลักษณ์, แมวทองแดง, RTGS: Maeo Suphalak, Maeo Thong Daeng) is a solid reddish-brown copper colored short-haired breed of cat originating in Thailand. The Suphalak is a natural breed and should not be confused with the sable Burmese cat, an established American and European created breed which expresses the colorpoint Burmese gene (cb) that results in a dark points on the extremities such as the ears, feet and tail as well as a dark mask on the face. A written description and pictorial of the Suphalak first appeared in the ancient Thai manuscripts (written by Buddhist monks) over 300 years ago known as the Tamra Maew.
             </p>
          
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Both a description and depiction of the Suphalak first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (the Cat-Book Poems) thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (AD 1351 to 1767). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand, while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library. and National Library of Australia. In addition to the Suphalak, the Tamra Maew also describes other heritage cats of Thailand, including the Wichien Maat (a seal point Siamese with pale blue eyes) and the Korat, which are still bred for preservation in Thailand today and have become popular in other countries.            </p>
            <p>
              When the capital city of Ayutthaya was sacked on 7 April 1767 at the end of the Burmese-Siamese War, the Burmese army burned everything in sight and returned to Burma taking Siamese noblemen and royal family members with them as captives. Buddha images were hacked apart for their gold, and all the royal treasures were stolen. Thai legend has it that the Burmese King Hsinbyushin found and read the poem for the Suphalak in the Tamra Maew. The poem describes the Suphalak as being as rare as gold, and anyone that owns this cat will become wealthy. He told his army to round up all the Suphalak cats and bring them back to Burma along with the other treasures. Today in Thailand this legend is told as a humorous explanation as to why the Suphalak is so rare.

            <p>
              Throughout the past several decades, many breeders in Thailand have bred Thong Daeng (translated as 'copper') cats with dark points and considered them to be Suphalaks. They were entered into cat shows in Thailand and exhibited as Suphalaks. Noted authors such as Martin Clutterbuck assumed this was the case. As a result, there was much confusion, especially among Burmese breeders who mistakenly insisted that Suphalaks were a solid sable-colored Burmese cat of Thai origin. Experienced Thai breeder Kamnan Preecha Pukkabu disagreed with these breeders because the ancient poems describe a cat with the 'whole body copper' appearance and that would mean even the skin (down to the paw pads) needed to be reddish in color and not dark or black like a sable-colored Burmese cat. Using one proper Suphalak male, he tried to resurrect this lost breed of cat with the ideal features, but without success. This has been attributed to two major problems, the first being that the Suphalak is so rare that breeders have had great difficulty finding them. Genetically, the Suphalak is a chocolate self, expressing two recessive alleles for the brown color 'b' and the dominant 'C' allele (full color) giving the Suphalak its solid brown color. For two recessive alleles to randomly combine without human intervention, i.e., in a Thai temple or on the street, is rare. Secondly, the solid copper chocolate Suphalak was so scarce that few people had ever seen one and even if they did, they would not know that there was anything special about it, so there was no concerted effort to preserve these cats and they never entered a breeding program until recently.            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to 2013 there was only one Suphalak in a breeding program, a male named Samsen who lives at the Thai Cat Preservation Center in Ampawa, Thailand. Samsen belongs to Kamnan Preecha Pukkabut, a breeder renowned for his life effort to preserve the Thai cats described in the Tamra Maew. Despite Kamnan Preecha's best efforts to resurrect this lost breed, he has been unable to reproduce the Suphalak.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2014 an association dedicated to the preservation of Thailand's heritage cats was established, The International Maew Boran Association (TIMBA) (Maew Boran translating to "Ancient Cat"). TIMBA focused its efforts on understanding the genetics responsible for the Suphalak and searching throughout Thailand for cats suitable for the Suphalak breeding program. Currently there are six foundation cats, one male and five females in active breeding programs, and all of them have all been genetically tested for their coat colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              To date, only one solid copper-chocolate Suphalak has been exported from Thailand. In May 2013, Kamnan Preecha declared one female (named 'Thonga') to be a proper Suphalak and suitable for breeding. In 2013, Thonga was shown and exhibited as a rare Suphalak at two different cat shows in Thailand, one being a large CFA, Royal Canin sponsored international show with judges from around the world. This was the first time a rare copper chocolate Suphalak had ever been entered in competition and presented to the public at any cat show. Later that year, Thonga was officially recorded as a Suphalak by the government export authorities of Thailand and imported by Lisa Young on September 29, 2013, to the United States where she remains in a breeding program at Thai Dee Maew Cattery in Waterford, Michigan. On September 6, 2015, Thonga became the first Suphalak ever registered as a Suphalak with an established cat registry, the American Cat Association (the oldest cat registry in America with their formal beginning in 1897). It was a milestone for the Suphalak, considering that so few are in existence. Due to the scarcity of Suphalaks in the world, ACA acceptable crosses are any cat of Thai origin including, but not limited to: Korats, Khao Manee, Konja or Siamese (shorthaired or longhaired). Thonga was mated with a traditional style Longhair Siamese, which resulted in two chocolate females. The first female had two white lockets, so could not be recorded as Suphalak as Suphalaks must have a whole body copper color and patches of white are not allowed for the breed. However, the second female born September 15, 2015, was solid copper chocolate and bright yellow eyes. She was the first Suphalak ever born outside of Thailand. Both Thonga and her older daughter have entered a breeding program where they are not only set to reproduce more Suphalaks, but also Tibetans and Traditional Orientals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suphalaks have made appearances at several cat shows in Thailand, including the first WCF Thailand National Show where the breed was exhibited and presented by the WCF Temporary General Secretary, Andreas Mobius.

              Appearance
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Suphalak's coat color should be a rich and even shade of warm brown throughout the body. The coat color is ideally more of a red-brown rather than a black-brown and does not show tabby markings. The Tamra Maew refers to this color as "thong daeng", or the color of copper. Breeders in Thailand today often compare the coat color to the pulp of the tamarind fruit pod, a common ingredient used in Thai cuisine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The overall body and head type should be consistent with the native population of domestic cats found in Thailand. The body is medium-sized, muscular and semi-foreign in type. The head type is described as a modified wedge, medium width and moderate length. Neither the body nor head type should be extreme in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The whiskers should be brown, complementing the coat color while the nose leather is a rosy-brown color. The paw pads should be light brown with a pink tone. The eye color is a bright yellow/gold color, described in the Tamra Maew as shining and sprinkling sun rays.
            </p>
            


            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>

              Like other cat breeds originating from Thailand, the Suphalak is notably people-oriented. They are intelligent, affectionate and playful, often taking on more of a dog-like personality and characteristics. They are communicative, active, playful and do not like to be left alone or ignored.

            <h3>Health issues</h3>
             <p>
              There are currently no known health issues with the Suphalak, as it is a newly developing breed. The Suphalak is, however, susceptible to common genetic diseases which are not breed-specific affecting all domestic cats.

              The <strong>Thai  </strong>  or Wichien Maat (Thai: วิเชียรมาศ, [wí.tɕʰīan.mâ:t] ⓘ, RTGS: wichianmat, meaning "diamond gold") is a newly renamed but old cat breed, related to but different from the Western, modern-style Siamese cat. This natural breed is descended from the cats of Thailand, and, among various groups of breeders in different times and places has also been called the Old-Style Siamese, Traditional Siamese, Classic Siamese; Wichien Maat (anglicised from the Thai name); and the Applehead, a nickname that originated in the 1950s (originally as a pejorative used by breeders of the modern-style, more extreme-featured Siamese). According to The International Cat Association: "The Thai is the breed dedicated to preserving the native pointed cat of Thailand in as close to its original form as possible."
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to the modern-style, more extreme-featured Siamese, the traditional Thai breed (and native wichienmaat specimens) have a much more moderate appearance.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Cats that were imported from Siam (today, Thailand) to Western countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries were more moderate in conformation than the modern Western Siamese. While the Thai has common ancestry with the Western Siamese, separate breeding, beginning after World War II, led to the development of two distinct breeds, with more extreme features dominating the cat show circuit and becoming the dominant variety of Siamese in the West. Starting in the 1980s, various breed clubs in both North America and Europe appeared that were dedicated to preserving the type that represents the early 20th-century Siamese and is still found in Thailand. The World Cat Federation (WCF) recognized the original style as a separate breed, Thai, with full championship competitive status, in 1990.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the United Kingdom and North America, the cats continued to be registered as Siamese. In 1999, in North America, the independent club PREOSSIA coined the name Old-Style Siamese to refer specifically to the moderate, original type of registered Siamese. In 2000, the Old-style Siamese Club, or OSSC, was formed in the UK. It was originally called The Classic Siamese Club but changed the name after someone in the USA claimed to have copyright over the name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Native pointed cats were imported directly from Thailand, beginning in 2001, to refresh the gene pool of the Western, pedigreed Thai breeding programmes and ensure that the traits of the indigenous Southeast Asian cats are preserved and distinct in these bloodlines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beginning in 2007, members of PREOSSIA began the new breed application process in The International Cat Association (TICA). It was necessary to request separate breed status from the Siamese to permit the Old-Style Siamese to be bred and shown using different registration rules and a different breed standard. However, TICA refused to allow the name Old-Style Siamese for the "new" breed, and breeders decided to follow the example of the Europeans and use the name Thai. In January 2010, the Thai was granted Championship status in TICA, enabling it to compete for top honours along with the other breeds of pedigreed cats. Although by this time, the Thai had been recognized by WCF for 20 years, one major European registry still had not recognised the breed. At last, in 2015, Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) accepted the Thai in its "Preliminary Recognized Breeds" class.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long before its re-branding as the Thai, the old type of Siamese was part of the foundation stock of a variety of new 20th-century breeds, such as the Himalayan, Ocicat, and Havana Brown. Near the end of the 20th century, modern Siamese were used more frequently for this purpose, as in the case of the Cornish Rex and Peterbald.
            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710104409/1312/Cats/Thai/Mimbi3_gy5lag.jpg" alt="Thai" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              As breeds, the Thai and the modern Siamese share common ancestry, the point colouration gene, and the outgoing, people-loving, vocal personality made famous in the West by the early 20th century imports. They differ only in "type," meaning the conformation of body and head.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary features of the Thai are that it is a "pointed" cat (blue eyes, dark extremities, pale body) of foreign body type (more elongated than the average Western domestic cat, but noticeably less so than the modern Siamese or Oriental); has a modified wedge-shaped head; a long flat forehead; a nose with no more than a slight concave curve at eye level; has a short, flat-lying single coat; does not carry the longhair gene; and it usually has a registered pedigree dating back to the late 19th century Siamese, with no Western domestic shorthair ancestors. In TICA, unregistered cats with import documentation proving origin in Thailand are also permitted to register as Thais—and Thailand imports have all the same breeding and show privileges that Western-bred Thais have. To permit British Thai breeders (isolated by still restrictive British rabies quarantine laws) to work with GCCF Old-Style Siamese, TICA also allows outcrossing to registered Siamese of moderate type. In WCF and FIFe, natural, unregistered cats born in Thailand are not allowed to register as Thais or be used as outcrosses. Outcrossing to the Siamese is also prohibited. However, when the Thai breed was new to WCF, there was a temporary period during which unregistered pointed European cats were allowed to register as Thais and outcrossing to other Western breeds was allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the foundation and concept of the Thai vary somewhat from one country's registry to the next, all define the Thai as a breed that preserves the characteristics of early Western Siamese. TICA uniquely defines the Thai as preserving the native, natural pointed cats of Thailand as well as the earliest Western Siamese. The goal of Thai breeders is always to preserve the old look, provide plenty of genetic diversity for a healthy future, and guarantee the authenticity and personality of the old type of Siamese.
            </p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710104451/1312/Cats/Thai/Tiam_Siamese_b0dosa.jpg" alt="Thai" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              In Thailand, the ancestor of this elegant cat is known as the wichienmaat which means "moon diamond". The wichienmaat, along with other cats, was named, described and illustrated centuries ago in the "Tamra Maew" book of cat poems. Over the years, the wichienmaat has stayed true to its original breeding, which is still seen today in Thailand where it remains a popular cat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting in the late 1800s, the wichienmaat was first imported to the West by British cat breeders, and the cats became known as "Siamese," after the name of the country Siam (today Thailand). Cat fanciers were impressed with the graceful, "marten-faced" cats so very different from the cobby, rounder native breeds and longhairs. Western breeders wanted to emphasize and augment the qualities that made the cats so different and through selective breeding, they developed an increasingly elongated, angular, finer-boned type of Siamese. This "modern" or "show-style" type of Siamese dominated the show halls by the latter half of the 20th century. As the new look became prevalent, some breeders in England, Europe, and North America decided to buck the trend and instead preserve the look of the old type of Siamese. These breeders tend to work with a variety of different registries, but they have long exchanged breeding stock; while some call their cats Old-Style Siamese, others call them Thais.

              The <strong>Tonkinese </strong>  is a domestic cat breed produced by crossbreeding between the Siamese and Burmese. Members of the breed are distinguished by a pointed coat pattern in a variety of colors. In addition to the modified coat colors of the "mink" pattern, which is a dilution of the point color (as in watercolors), the breed is now being shown in the foundation-like Siamese and Burmese colors: pointed with white and solid overall (sepia).
             </p>
            <p>
              The best known variety is the short-haired Tonkinese, but there is a semi-longhaired (sometimes called Tibetan) which tends to be more popular in Europe, mainly in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The modern Tonkinese breed is a reconstruction of a breed brought to the West in the 19th century. These cats were originally known as 'chocolate Siamese'. Breeders working with imported cats from Malaysia noticed some cats have aquamarine eyes and darker coats than the Siamese. In 1901 the Siamese Cat Club recognised them as a Siamese of the 'chocolate' type.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many of the cats used to found the Siamese and Burmese in the West are believed to be Tonkinese, including Wong Mau. Tonkinese would be bred still but registered as either Burmese or Siamese, it was not until the 1950s that breeders would take interest in the cat. These breeders worked together on developing breeding lines with these cats and by 1965 the Tonkinese was recognised in Canada as a distinct breed — whence the name originated.
            </p>

            <p>
              More modern Tonkinese cats are the result of the crossbreeding programs of two breeders working independently of each other. Margaret Conroy, of Canada, and Jane Barletta, of the United States, crossed the Siamese and Burmese breeds, with the aim of creating the ideal combination of both parent breeds' distinctive appearance and lively personalities. The cats thus produced were moved from crossbreed classification to an established breed in 2001. The name is a reference to the Tonkin region of Indochina, though it is suggestive only, as the cats have no connection with the area.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the West, Tonkinese cats under the age of sixth months have historically been referred to as "small-cats" rather than "kittens" to reflect a more direct translation from Burmese, although this term has become almost obsolete since the mid-20th century.
            </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            
            <p>
              The breed received championship status with the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1984. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognised the breed in 1991. Today the breed is recognised in most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Africa. Over 30 countries have Tonkinese cats featured on postage stamps.

            <p>
              Tonkinese are a medium-sized cat, considered an intermediate type between the slender, long-bodied modern Siamese and European Burmese and the more "cobby", or substantially-built American Burmese. Like their Burmese ancestors, they are deceptively muscular and typically seem much heavier than expected when picked up. Tail and legs are slim but proportionate to the body, with distinctive oval paws. They have a gently rounded, slightly wedge-shaped head and blunted muzzle, with moderately almond-shaped eyes and ears set towards the outside of their head. The American style is a rounder but sculpted head with a shorter body and sturdier appearance to reflect the old-fashioned Siamese and rounded Burmese from which it was originally bred in the United States. While many American breeders avoided using the extreme "contemporary" Burmese in favor of the more moderate "traditional" Burmese, the original Tonkinese breed standard was based on the extreme spherical style of the Burmese descended from Wong Mau.

              The <strong>Toyger</strong> is a breed of domestic cat, the result of breeding domestic shorthaired tabbies (beginning in the 1980s) to make them resemble a "toy tiger", as its striped coat is reminiscent of the tiger's. The breed's creator, Judy Sugden, has stated that the breed was developed in order to inspire people to care about the conservation of tigers in the wild. It was recognized for "registration only" by The International Cat Association in the early 2000s, and advanced through all requirements to be accepted as a full championship breed in 2012. There are about 20 breeders in the United States and another 15 or so in the rest of the world, as of 2012. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, 469 toygers are registered on the Pawpeds Database.            
            </p>
         
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed began development in the 1980s in the U.S. when Judy Sugden, a breeder looking to find the difference between the mackerel markings in tabbies, noticed distinctive markings in one of her cats. These tiny spots occurring on the temples of the face (an area normally devoid of distinct pattern) proved genetically that the circular tiger face pattern could be possible in a domestic cat. After importing a tom from the streets of India with noticeable spotting breaking up the usual tabby lines on the top of the head, the quest to develop a toy-tiger began in earnest. About forty domestic cats from various countries were selected over several years as foundation stock, including Bengals, unpedigreed domestic short-haired cats with stripes, and at least one cat imported from India for its ear markings; each provided a specific desired trait or reinforcing ones already chosen (especially the striped appearance).
            </p>
            <p>
              Judy Sugden was the daughter of Jean Mill (maiden name Jean Sugden). Jean Mill succeeded in creating the Domestic Bengal cat.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1993, TICA accepted the Toyger for Registration and in 2000 advanced them to new breed exhibition classes, granting them full recognition as a championship breed in February 2007.

              Muzzle: Well-defined, long, broad, and deep with rounded muscular contours. Full face view suggests an inverted heart shape. The front muzzle line/plane is skewed forward to produce a more frontal view of nose leather, mouth, and chin than in most small felines. <br>
              Nose: Muscular, long, broad, and rounded, widening toward the end to at least as wide as the space between the eyes. <br>
              Torso: Medium to deep, long and muscular with rounded contours; strong and robust but not blocky. <br>
              Legs and feet: Medium length such that the space between the ground and the body is roughly equal to the depth of the torso. Boning is very large. <br>
              Tail: Very long and not thick. Taper is slight with blunt, rounded tip. Fur is dense and short. <br>
              Musculature: Very muscular and athletic looking, especially in young males. <br>
              Coat length: Coat is uniformly short. Fur may be longer in the temple jowl/ruff; the suggestion of more of a ruff is preferred. <br>
              Color: Markings shall be virtually black to brown to even tan. Very dark markings are preferred. A bright pumpkin ground color with very dark markings is preferred. Whited ground color shall be as uniformly light to virtually white as possible. <br>
              Markings pattern: Mackerel tabby. The markings to the ground pattern contrast must be extreme and distinct, giving a clear, sharply edged pattern. <br>
              Body markings: Body stripes shall generally be vertically aligned with encircling markings on neck, legs, and tail. Bold, braided, and non-uniform stripes are preferred. Belly and inside of legs must be marked. Paw pads and tail tip must be black. <br>
              Head: Facial stripes and markings shall be circularly aligned around the face. Traditional tabby markings moving radially away from the face for any distance are undesirable and has an "M" marking on its forehead. Lighter to virtually white "thumb marks" on the back of the ears are desirable. Natural "make-up" look is important: eyes must have black mascara-like markings and whited spectacles; desirable for mouth to have black lipstick markings. <br>

              The <strong>Turkish Angora
              </strong>(Turkish: Ankara kedisi, 'Ankara cat') is a breed of domestic cat. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, natural breeds of cat, having originated in central Anatolia (Ankara Province in modern-day Turkey). The breed has been documented as early as the 17th century. Outside of the United States, the breed is usually referred to as simply the Angora or Ankara cat. These cats have slender and elegant bodies.
            </p>
         
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Like all domestic cats, Turkish Angoras descended from the African wildcat (Felis lybica). Their ancestors were among the cats that were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent.
            </p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1711054841/1312/Cats/Turkish%20Angora/Persian_aka_Angora_from_1894_ptyorj.jpg" alt="Turkish Angora" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Longhaired cats were imported to Britain and France from Asia Minor, Persia and Russia as early as the late 16th century. The Turkish Angora was recognised as a distinct breed in Europe by the 17th century. However, there is a strong connection between Angoras and Persians. Charles Catton, in the 1788 book Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta, gave "Persian cat" and "Angora cat" as alternative names for the same breed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Persian cat was developed from Turkish Angora mutations by British and American cat breeders. In 1903, Frances Simpson wrote in The Book of the Cat:
            </p>
            <p>
              "In classing all long-haired cats as Persians I may be wrong, but the distinctions, apparently with hardly any difference, between Angoras and Persians are of so fine a nature that I must be pardoned if I ignore the class of cat commonly called Angora, which seems gradually to have disappeared from our midst. Certainly, at our large shows there is no special classification given for Angoras, and in response to many inquiries from animal fanciers I have never been able to obtain any definite information as to the difference between a Persian and an Angora."
            </p>

            <p>
              The Angora of the 20th century was used for improvement in the Persian coat, but the type has always been divergent from the Persian—particularly as the increasingly flat-faced show cat Persian has been developed in the last few decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 20th century, Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo began a breeding program to protect and preserve pure white Angoras. The zoo particularly prised odd-eyed specimens; however, the cats were chosen only for their colour - no other criterion was applied.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Turkish Angora, which was brought to Canada in 1963, was accepted as a championship pedigreed breed in 1973 by the Cat Fanciers' Association. However, until 1978 only white Angoras were recognised. Today, all North American registries accept the Turkish Angora in many colours and patterns. While their numbers are still relatively small, the gene pool is continually growing.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>

            <p>
              The Angora has a silky coat that covers a long muscular body. Though it is known for a shimmery white coat and posh tail, Turkish Angoras can display a variety of coat colours, with the only disallowed coats being chocolate, lavender, or colourpoint. The Angora's head is small to medium in size with a smooth wedge. The body is long and slender with good fineness of the bone.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Eyes are large and almond shaped. The colour may be blue, green, amber, yellow, as well as heterochromatic. Ears are pointed, large and wide-set. The eyes are almond shaped and the profile forms two straight planes. The plumed tail is often carried upright, perpendicular to the back.
            </p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              Turkish Angoras are playful, intelligent, athletic and involved. They bond with humans, but often select a particular member of a family to be their constant companion, whom they are very protective of.            
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The gene responsible for blue eyes and white coat in the Angora can cause deafness. There have been reports of kittens suffering from ataxia as well as adult cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Genetic variations</h3>

            <p>
              Breeders in Turkey feel that the cat's fine-boned version of its natural breed is unrepresentative of the true Turkish cats, which are much sturdier. American "Turkish" Angoras have only a minimal remnant of the original Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo DNA, and are only "purebred on paper".
            </p> 
            <p>
              A genetic study of pedigree cat breeds (using DNA taken from pedigreed cats in the U.S. and Europe) and worldwide random-bred populations showed the Turkish Van as a distinct population from the Turkish Angora despite their geographical association. The Turkish Angora was grouped with the pedigreed Egyptian Mau and random-bred Tunisian cats. Turkish random-bred cats were grouped with Israeli random-bred cats while the Turkish Van was grouped with Egyptian random-bred cats. However, the UC Davis studied only American cat fancy registered Angoras rather than the "true" Turkish Angora or Ankara Kedisi directly from Turkey, and especially from the Ankara Zoo.
            </p>
            <p>
              A genetic study published in 2012 included a few cats imported from Turkey. The study found that "Turkish- versus USA-originating Turkish Angoras ... are resolved as separate breed populations." The American Turkish Angoras are categorised as descendants of European random-bred cats, and cats imported from Turkey "were assigned to the Eastern Mediterranean" group.

              The <strong>Turkish Van</strong> is a semi-long-haired, standardised breed of domestic cat, which was developed in the United Kingdom from a selection of cats obtained from various cities of modern Turkey, especially southeast Turkey. The breed is rare, is one of the larger breeds, and is distinguished by the Van pattern (named after the breed), where the colour is restricted to the head and the tail, and the rest of the cat is white; this is due to the expression of the piebald white spotting gene, a type of partial leucism. A Turkish Van may have blue or amber eyes, or be odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour).</p>
            <p>
              The breed was first recognised as such by a breeder/fancier organisation, the UK-based Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF), in 1969, under the name Turkish cat.It was later renamed Turkish Van to better distinguish it from the Turkish Angora breed. The Turkish Van has been claimed to be descended from (and is often confused with) the landrace of usually all-white Van cats, mostly found near Lake Van, though one of the two original breeders' own writings indicate clearly that none of the breed's foundation cats came from the Van area.            
            </p>
           
            <h3>Breed standards</h3>
            <p>
              Breed standards allow for one or more body spots as long as there is no more than 20% colour and the cat does not give the appearance of a bicolour. A few random spots are acceptable, but they should not detract from the pattern. The rest of the cat is white. Although red tabby and white is the classic Van colour, the colour on a Van's head and tail can be one of the following: red, cream, black, blue, red tabby, cream tabby, brown tabby, blue tabby, tortoiseshell, dilute tortoiseshell (also known as blue-cream), brown-patched tabby, blue-patched tabby, and any other colour not showing evidence of crossbreeding with the point-coloured breeds (Siamese, Himalayan, etc.). Not all registries recognise all of these colour variations.
            </p>
            <p>
              While a few registries recognise all-white specimens as Turkish Vans, most do not. The US-based Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA, the world's largest registry of pedigreed cats) and Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe, the largest international cat fancier organisation) recognise only Van-patterned specimens, as they define the breed by both its type and pattern. The Germany-based but international World Cat Federation (WCF) considers the all-white specimens a separate breed, which it calls the Turkish Vankedisi, a name that is easily confused with the landrace Van cat, which is called Van kedisi (two words) in Turkish. In other registries, the all-white cats are not considered show quality and are therefore actively bred against. They are prone to deafness; this is a common defect with many all-white animals.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>
              In 1955, two British photographers, Laura Lushington and Sonia Halliday, while on assignment in Turkey for the Turkish Ministry of Tourism, were given two unrelated cats in Turkey, which Lushington took home with her and allowed to mate. When the offspring came out identical to their parents - chalk white with dark tail and head markings - she set to establishing a standardised breed, originally named Turkish cat, later Turkish Van, and having it recognised by the British cat fancy organisations. Lushington returned to Turkey to find another pair, with the goal of breeding to the standard "three clear generations".            
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Lushington, her original imported cats were: Van Iskenderun Guzelli (female), a cat that came from Hatay Province, Iskenderun, and Stambul Byzantium (male), a cat given by a hotel manager in Istanbul, both in 1955. Two later additions to the gene pool were Antalya Anatolia (female), from the city of Antalya, and Burdur (male), from Burdur city, both in 1959. Lushington did not see Van city before 1963, and only stayed there "for two days and two nights". It is unclear why the name "Turkish Van" was chosen, or why one of the original 1955 kittens was named "Van Iskenderun Guzelli", given their provenance. Of the founding 1955 pair, Lushington wrote, in 1977:
            </p>
            <p>
              I was first given a pair of Van kittens in 1955 while travelling in Turkey, and decided to bring them back to England, although touring by car and mainly camping at the time - the fact that they survived in good condition showed up the great adaptability and intelligence of their breed in trying circumstances. Experience showed that they bred absolutely true. They were not known in Britain at that time and, because they make such intelligent and charming pets, I decided to try to establish the breed, and to have it recognised officially in Britain by the GCCF.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is unclear whether Lushington was intending to imply that the Hatay and Istanbul kittens had originally come from the Lake Van region, or was simply referring to the Turkish Van foundation stock as "Van kittens" for short. Neither city is near Van Province, and there is no evidence that specimens of the Van cat landrace were ever among the foundation stock.
            </p>

              The Turkish Van was given full pedigree status in 1969 by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Called simply the Turkish cat at this point, the name was changed in 1979 in the UK (1985 in the US) to Turkish Van to better distance the breed from the Turkish Angora cat (originally called simply Angora, an old spelling of Ankara).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Turkish Van began to be imported into America in the 1970s. Beginning in 1983, two Florida breeders, Barbara and Jack Reark, worked to popularise this breed, and in 1985, The International Cat Association (TICA) granted the Turkish Van championship status. In 1988, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) accepted the breed for registration in the miscellaneous class. The CFA later bestowed provisional status to the Van in 1993, and championship status in 1994. In that first year, four Turkish Vans attained the grand title.

            <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710806279/1312/Cats/Turkish%20Van/TurkishVanRandomSpots_pxpws9.jpg" alt="Turkish Van" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Turkish Van is a large, muscular cat with a moderately long body and tail. It has strong, broad shoulders and a short neck; the jock of the cat world. The body of a Van should neither be stocky, or thin. It should call to mind the body build of an athlete, and indeed, it is one of the largest cats. They take from 3 to 5 years to reach their full maturity and when they do males range in weight from 10 - 20 pounds with females ranging from 7 - 12 pounds.
            </p>
             <p>
              The coat on a Turkish Van is considered semi-long-haired. While many cats have three distinct hair types in their coat - guard hair, awn hair, and down hair - the Turkish Van has no evident undercoat, only one coat. This makes their coat feel like cashmere or rabbit fur. The lack of an undercoat gives a sleek appearance. The coat is uncommonly water repellent, which makes bathing these cats a challenge, though the coat dries quickly. The breed actually has two lengths of hair, determined by season. In the winter, the hair is thick and long. In the summer, the hair sheds to leave a shorter, lighter coat. The coat begins short at birth and grows in gradually over a period of three to five years, so that the kittens may be short-haired in appearance, with thin tails, but as they mature, the fur on the chest will fill out, and the tail will thicken into a full brush tail. The tail does not shed hair or change according to the season, but remains long and full. The ears remain feathered with fur, so that even with its summer coat, the Van looks soft and fluffy.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Turkish Van is one of the larger cat breeds. Ideal type should feature broad shoulders with a body that is "top-heavy", that is, a cat with its center of gravity forward. The cat is moderately long, and its back legs are slightly longer than its front legs, but neither the cat itself nor its legs are so long as to be disproportionate. They have large paws and rippling hard muscle structure which allows them to be very strong jumpers. Vans can easily hit the top of a refrigerator from a cold start on the floor. They are slow to mature and this process can take 3 years, possibly longer. Vans have been known to reach 3 ft (1 m) long from nose to tip of tail.
             </p>
             <p>
              A Turkish Van may have blue eyes, amber eyes, or be odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour, a condition known as heterochromia iridis).
             </p>
             <p>
              The breed typically has very large ears when it is a kitten, growing into its ears over time. The nose is straight and Asiatic, considered long for a semi-longhair, and with its high cheek bones, and startlingly bright eyes, it gives off quite an exotic appearance.
             </p>
             <h3>Behavior</h3>
             <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710806279/1312/Cats/Turkish%20Van/Hobie_the_cat__rear_view_ywzkkw.jpg" alt="Turkish Van" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              The TICA standard notes several characteristics, including their high intelligence, energy and playfulness - also making them somewhat mischievous. Muscular and highly driven, they like to climb and perch high up, to study their environment, and they get around their domain with impressive athleticism. They make quite successful hunters as a consequence. Their drive makes them easily trainable with positive reinforcement - to play fetch, do tricks or walk on a leash. Although there may be efforts to move the breed towards greater sociability. a 2021 study in Finland did find that the Turkish Vans in their research showed higher than average tendencies towards fearfulness, aggression towards humans, as well as a lower stress tolerance (notable excessive grooming and litter-box problems), and lower sociability to humans and cats.
             </p>
             <p>
              Curious, Turkish Vans want to be with their owner participating in whatever is happening, and so they may follow a person from room to room. While Turkish vans are affectionate to their family members, these are not normally lap cats. They may lie next to their owners and will happily allow themselves to be petted, but this is not a breed that tolerates being picked up and often wants to be near their owner, not on their owner.
             </p>
             <p>
              Turkish Vans do well in a single-pet household and don't seem to suffer much from separation anxiety. When put in a home with other cats, they much prefer being around other Turkish Vans. Dogs can be no problem as long as they are introduced properly and patiently.
             </p>
             <p>
              When it comes to families, Turkish Vans are happy to play with children, but care must be taken to make sure small ones are reminded that the breed may not enjoy being held, and may strike out if forced into such a situation. The native Van cats of Turkey have been nicknamed the "swimming cats", due to an unusual fascination with water. Despite the modern Turkish Van breed consisting almost entirely of pedigreed, indoor-only cats with no access to large bodies of water, and despite dubious connections between them and the cats of the Lake Van area, some feel that the Turkish Van has a notable affinity for water; for example, instead of swimming in a lake, they may stir their water bowls or play with water in the toilet, and some may even follow their owners into water. However, the idea that the breed likes water more than other cats may be mistaken according to some pet writers.
             </p>
             <h3>Genetics</h3>
             <p>
              The Turkish Van is largely free of genetic issues and breed-specific health defects. Unlike the Turkish Angora, the Turkish Van does not have issues with deafness.

Additionally, due to the Turkish Van's larger size, spay or neutering procedures are sometimes delayed to around 1 year of age, as an early adjustment to their hormone levels can affect how their bones and muscles grow.
             </p>
             <p>
              The piebald spotting gene (partial leucism) appears in other different species (like the horse and the ball python). It also shows up in other breeds of cat, since the Van pattern is merely an extreme expression of the gene.
             </p>
             <p>
              The breed's variability of eye colour is genetically caused by the white spotting factor, which is a characteristic of this breed. The white spotting factor is the variable expression of the piebald gene that varies from the minimal degree (1), as in the blue-eyed cats with white tip on the tail to the maximal degree (8-9) that results in a Van-patterned cat, when coloured marks occupy at most 20% of the white background, but the white background in the breed covers about 80% of the body. Breeding two cats together with the same level of white spotting will produce cats with a similar degree of spotting.
             </p>
             <p>
              Van-patterned Turkish Vans are not prone to deafness, because their phenotype is associated with the Van pattern (Sv) semi-dominant gene. Solid-white Turkish Angoras carry the epistatic (masking) white colour (W) dominant gene associated with white fur, blue eyes, and often deafness. All-white cats of Turkish Van stock may share this gene. All three types of cat may exhibit eye colours that are amber, blue or odd. Deafness is principally associated with white cats having two blue eyes.
             </p>

              The <strong>Van</strong>  (Turkish: Van kedisi; Western Armenian: Վանայ կատու, romanized: Vana gadu; Eastern Armenian: Վանա կատու, romanized: Vana katu; Kurdish: pisîka Wanê) is a distinctive landrace (or "natural breed") of the domestic cat found around Lake Van in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Van cats are relatively large, have a chalky white coat, sometimes with ruddy coloration on the head and hindquarters, and have blue or amber eyes or have heterochromia (one eye of each colour). The variety has been referred to as "the swimming cat", and has been observed to swim in Lake Van.
            </p>
            <p>
              The naturally occurring Van cat type is popularly believed to be the basis of the Turkish Van breed, as standardised and recognised by many cat fancier organizations; it has been internationally selectively bred to consistently produce the ruddy head-and-tail colouring pattern on the white coat. However, one of the breed founders' own writings indicate that the four original cats used to found the formal breed came from parts of Turkey other than the Lake Van area. The run-together term "Turkish Vankedisi" is confusingly used by some organisations as a name for all-white specimens of the standardised Turkish Van breed.

            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Van cats have been reported living in the vicinity of the city of Van and the general Lake Van area for centuries; how long is uncertain. Genetic research has shown that the domestic cat's ancestor, the African wild cat (Felis lybica), was domesticated, for rodent control, about 9,000 years ago in the Near East when tribes transitioned from hunter-gathering to crop farming and settled life. In addition, the white-spotting in domestic cats appeared at the earliest stage of cat domestication, and is one of the points of evidence of early artificial selection. However, this does not necessarily mean that white cats have been in the Van area the entire time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The landrace is named Van kedisi (plural kedileri) in Turkish, Vana gadu (Վանայ կատու) or Vana katu (Վանա կատու) in Western and Eastern Armenian, respectively, and pisîka Wanê in Kurdish.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dapwniqqn/image/upload/v1710972027/1312/Cats/Van/Van_cat_kitten_odeuho.jpg" alt="Van" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Van cats are all-white, or sometimes mostly white with amber markings around the tail and ears. Locals to the Van area identify only the all-white type as Van cats, according to a 1991 BBC documentary, Cats, written and presented by Roger Tabor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their most notable genetic characteristic is their almond-shaped eyes that often are mismatched colours. The most valued members of the type generally have one amber-green eye and one blue eye.
            </p>

            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              Van cats are known for swimming in Lake Van. This may be the source of the popular, but possibly false or exaggerated, belief that the formal Turkish Van breed is innately more fond of water than the average cat. Lushington wrote: "Apart from their great capacity for affection and alert intelligence, their outstanding characteristic is their liking for water, not normally regarded as a feline attribute. They not only dabble in water and play with it, but have been known to enter ponds and even horse-troughs for a swim - they soon became famous as the 'swimming cats.'" It is unclear if Lushington means the cats of the Lake Van area, or her own Turkish Van standardised breed. Tabor's BBC documentary states: "The reason for [its] fame is that the Van cat is known as 'the swimming cat'.... [H]ere at Lake Van ... these cats do enter it, and swim."

            <h3>Current status</h3>
             <p>
              Van cats form a landrace (naturally occurring, free-breeding variety, often feral), not a standardized breed of cat. They can still be found in east Turkey, near Lake Van, although their numbers have diminished (a 1992 survey found only 92 pure Van cats in their native area). There is a breeding programme for the all-white variety, operated by the Van Cat Research Centre (a.k.a. the Van Cat House), established in 1995 at the campus of Yüzüncü Yil University. As of 2018, the centre housed about 350 young adults and kittens, is open to the public for a nominal entrance fee, and cats can be adopted. However, reports have suggested that the living conditions for the cats held there are not optimal, and the programme seems to be ineffective in reversing Van cats' declining numbers.
             </p>
             <h3>Armenian</h3>
             <p>
              Armenians often consider the breed to be historically Armenian, as the Lake Van area had a large Armenian population and was within the Armenian homeland prior to their local extermination during the genocide of 1915. The local Armenians were said to have "revered" the cat.
             </p>
             <p>
              Among them was post-impressionist and surrealist artist Arshile Gorky, later an immigrant to the United States, who sculpted Van cats in the early 1910s. Armenian writer Vrtanes Papazian wrote a short novel in which the cat has been used as a symbol of the Armenian liberation movement. Armenian authors Raffi, Axel Bakunts, and Paruyr Sevak have featured Van cats in their works.

             <h3>Turkish</h3>
             <p>
              Cat breeder Laura Lushington (co-founder of the "Turkish Van" formal breed, from cats procured from various parts of Turkey), wrote of the local Van cats, "they are much loved and prized by the Turks for their exceptional character and unique colouring."

Turkish folklore has it that a Van cat was aboard Noah's Ark, and that as the flood waters receded, Allah (God) blessed the cat with a ruddy patch of fur on its head when it left the ark, after which it made its way to the city of Van via Mount Ararat. Many Van cats are all-white, however.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the end of the 19th century, Sultan Abdul Hamid II is said to have owned a Van cat, and having one is still seen as a status symbol: a Prime Minister of Turkey received one as a gift, and an ambassador from Greece put himself on a waiting list to get one. Kittens from the breeding programme could be purchased for the equivalent of US$282 in 2011, and the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (which also regulates livestock) does not control the export of these or any other cats from Turkey. The 1991 BBC documentary indicated that the all-white cats are locally prized in Van, and even coveted by visitors. While most Van cats are feral street cats, tourists have been known to steal pet Van cats from residents.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the late 1990s, Van cats emerged as an informal municipal symbol of the city of Van - an enormous statue of a Van cat and her kitten now stands at the entrance to the city. The cat appears in a locally published comic strip, and in the logos of bus companies, shopping centres, and various other Van businesses.
             </p>
             <p>
              The mascot of the 2010 FIBA World Championship of basketball, hosted by Turkey, was an anthropomorphised Van cat named Bascat. He had a white coat and odd eyes, one blue and one green, and his head was shaped with design cues from the crescent moon on the Turkish flag.
             </p>
             <h3>Kurdish</h3>
             <p>
              The Van region has a large Kurdish population, and Van cats have been referred to as "Kurdish cats" or the "Kurdish Van cat", and made a symbol of Kurdistan in Kurdish nationalist circles. Some media sources reported that Turkish soldiers poisoned about 200 Van cats. These claims ultimately seem to have come from an animal rescue group called SOS Van Cats Rescue Action, a spokesperson for which stated: "The cats are Kurdish, and the Turkish authorities are unable to digest this." Van University's cat-breeding project responded: "That the Turkish army would be able to find 200 Van cats, let alone poison them, is utter nonsense".

              The <strong>Ukrainian Levkoy
              </strong> (Ukrainian: Український левкой) is a cat breed of distinct appearance, having inward-folding ears and little to no hair. These cats are of medium size with a longish body, appearing both muscular and slender. They have soft, elastic skin; an excess of which leads to a wrinkled appearance. The breed is not recognized by any major, international cat fancier and breeder organizations, only Ukrainian and Russian clubs.
                   </p>
            <p>
              The Levkoy's peculiar features are: special angular contour of its head and "stepped" profile (dog-face appearance), folded ears and large, but not wide almond-shaped eyes. The cats express sexual dimorphism.
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Ukrainian Levkoy is recent man-made breed (2000-2011), originally developed by Olena Biriukova in Ukraine. Created by crossing or by outbreeding hairless Donskoy females with Scottish Fold males, the Ukrainian Levkoy has a distinct and unique appearance. Two spontaneous mutations of dominant FD genes of cats with folded ears (that appeared in a simple domestic cat in Scotland) were used, as well as a spontaneous natural dominant mutation of hairlessness or baldness of the domestic cat gene BD in Russia. Both had appeared in the last century in Scotland and in Russia. Oriental and Domestic cats were also used in mating to obtain the required individual characteristics of the Ukrainian Levkoy. The breed was recognized in 2005 in Ukraine by ICFA RUI (Rolandus Union International). It was recognized in Russia in 2010 by ICFA WCA. In Ukraine, starting in September 2010, it was deemed that Ukrainian Levkoys may be awarded the title of "Champion" and that they may take part in "The Best in Show" competition. Nowadays there are 10 Ukrainian Levkoys who are given these titles. In Russia the first titles of "Champion" and "The Best in Show" were given in 2011. The other organizations are mating this new breed of Ukrainian Levkoy as an experimental breed without the "Champion" title at cats exhibitions.
            </p>
            <h3>Personality</h3>

            <p>
              Ukrainian Levkoys are friendly, playful, and intelligent cats. Levkoys are very sociable, enjoying human or family company as well as the company of other domestic pets (e.g., dogs, rats, pigs). Unclothed Ukrainian Levkoys do not need brushing but do need special skin care to give protection against direct sun and particularly cold conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>Development and appearance</h3>
            <p>
              From the top view the head of a Ukrainian Levkoy resembles a soft outlined pentagon that is a little longer than it is broad, where the muzzle length is only 1/3 the length of the head. The forehead is rather low and the skull is long and flat. Prominent cheekbones and eyebrows form angular outlines of the head. The profile of the cat head is "stepped" of two levels. The upper lines of the nose bridge and of the head are almost parallel. The whiskers are curly, may be shortly snapped, and then the neck is of medium length, muscular, and slightly arches from the shoulder to the base of the skull.
            </p>
            <p>
              Its body is medium to long, muscular, and slender. The back line slightly arched with a broad, oval chest. Its legs are rather long with long mobile toes. The ears are large and set high and wide apart. 1/2 to 1/3 of each ear is roundly folded forward and down, without touching the head.
            </p>
             <h3>Defects and disqualification</h3>
            <p>
              Gene FD is evident in the organism of the cat in homozygous, both parents may serve as provocation of bones illness such arthritis or the others bones mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disqualification results due to defects of the born structures, or crossed eyes. Other disqualify in accordance with the show rules. For example, too short or round of a head, round eyes, short "cobby" body, weak chin, or stressful behavior.

              The <strong>York Chocolate</strong> (or simply York) is an uncommon American breed of show cat, with a long, fluffy coat and a tapered tail and most of them were mostly or entirely chocolate-brown or the dilute form of brown, known as lavender. The breed was named after New York state, where it was established in 1983. This breed was created by color-selecting domestic long-haired cats of mixed ancestry. The breed is not widely recognized by cat registries. It is not recognized by the major organizations such as The International Cat Association (TICA), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA - North America) or Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe - Europe).

              As “Il Gatto Cioccolato” it found favour in Italy and the International York Chocolate Federation (IYCF) was founded there in 2003. The IYCF claimed affiliation with the German Feline Federation Europe (FFE)/Bavarian Cat Fanciers' Association (BCFA), which published a standard (minus colour information) in 2004. It also claimed affiliation with the Russian World Felinological Federation (WFF), although the latter does not recognize the York Chocolate as breed.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was created by Janet Chiefari in 1983. The father was a black longhaired cat and the mother was a longhaired black and white cat. Their Siamese ancestors created the brown coloring in one kitten: Brownie. Brownie had a litter that subsequent summer with a black longhaired tom. There were two kittens in the litter: a chocolate male and a white and chocolate female. Upon noticing similarities in coat and body types, Chiefari began her own breeding program.

              The breed is recognized, under the shorter name York, by the recently founded World Cat Federation based in Germany, and with some differences from previously published standards, most of which seem to be lost. The breed is not recognized by any major, long-established international cat fancier organizations, such as The International Cat Association (TICA), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) or Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), nor even US national groups such as the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). In March 1990, the Cat Fanciers' Federation of the New England area of the US recognized York Chocolates as an "experimental" cat breed, and allegedly gave it championship status within the group in March 1992, but publishes no breed standard or any other information about the breed today. It was supposedly granted champion status by the Canadian Cat Association in March 1995, as well, but while the CCA published a breed standard in 1995, as of March 2013, the organization no longer advertises it, and it includes outdated wording.

              A small breed club, the International York Chocolate Federation (IYCF) was founded in Italy, but seems to have been dormant since 2004. It claims affiliation with Feline Federation Europe (FFE), which since 2004 publishes a York Chocolate standard (missing the color information) and the World Felinological Federation (WFF), a Russian group, which does not recognize this breed.
