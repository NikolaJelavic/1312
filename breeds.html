            <p><strong>Abyssinian cat</strong> is a breed of domestic short-haired cat with a distinctive "ticked" tabby coat, in which individual hairs are banded with different colors. They are also known simply as Abys.

            The first members of the breed to be exhibited in England were brought there from Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia), whence the name. Genetic studies place the breed's origins in Southeast Asia and the coasts of the Indian Ocean, however. It is possible that the breed was introduced to Abyssinia by travelers who had stopped in Calcutta.
            
            Once a comparatively obscure breed, the Abyssinian had become one of the top five most popular cat breeds by 2016.
            
            The breed's distinctive appearance, seeming long, lean and finely colored compared to other cats, has been analogized to that of human fashion models. Personality-wise, the cats traditionally display active, curious attitudes in which they frequently follow owners around and encourage play. Their dog-like characteristics also involve a particular sense of affection and desire for interaction. Abys have a distinctive wildcat look with their ticked coat and large erect ears. They are a highly social breed and can be demanding of attention. They do well in multi-cat households due to their social nature. Not a lap cat, Abyssinians are in constant motion, either exploring or playing.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            What is thought to be the earliest known designated Abyssinian cat is in an exhibit still residing in the Leiden Zoological Museum in Holland. It was purchased around 1834-1836 from a supplier of small wild cat exhibits as a taxidermy and was labeled by the museum founder as "Patrie, domestica India." The first example of a domesticated Abyssinian, however, involves the story of a cat being brought to England by the British Lt. General Sir Robert Napier in 1868 who had returned from the Abyssinia War. The cat was given the name "Zula" and won first prize in the December 1871 Crystal Palace cat show.

Many modern Abyssinian breeders dispute Zula as having been the first domestic Abyssinian, arguing that the existing illustrations of Zula portray the cat as having ears too small for an Abyssinian and a coat too waved and long.

The breed was nearly wiped out in the United Kingdom following the Second World War and an outbreak of feline leukaemia virus, resulting in cats being imported from places such as Holland, America, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand.

The Abyssinian is one of the oldest established cat breeds, being recognised in 1929 by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. The breed was developed in the United Kingdom with references dating back to the 1890's.
          </p>
          <h3>Appearance</h3>
          <img src="img/Abyssinian/Valentino.jpg" alt="abbysinian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg" >
          <p>
            The Abyssinian is a lithe, fine-boned, muscular, medium to large sized cat. The average weight is 10 lb (4.5 kg) ranging between 8-12 lb (3.6-5.4 kg) with height ranging between 8-10 in (20-25 cm). The head is moderately wedge-shaped, with a slight break at the muzzle, and nose and chin ideally forming a straight vertical line when viewed in profile. They have alert, relatively large pointed ears. The eyes are almond-shaped and are gold, green, hazel or copper depending on coat color. The legs tend to be long in proportion to a graceful body, with small oval paws; the tail is likewise long and tapering.

Abyssinian kittens are born with dark coats that gradually lighten as they mature, usually over several months. The coat is short, and is ideally fine, not soft, dense, close-lying and silky to the touch. The ticked or agouti effect that is the trademark of the breed—genetically a variant of the tabby pattern—should be uniform over the body, although the ridge of the spine and tail, back of the hind legs and the pads of the paws are always noticeably darker. Each hair has a light base with three or four bands of additional color growing darker towards the tip. The base color should be as clear as possible; any extensive intermingling with grey is considered a serious fault. A tendency to white on the chin is common but likewise must be minimal. The typical tabby M-shaped marking is often found on the forehead.

The breed's original color standard is a warm deep reddish-brown base with black ticking, known as "usual" in the United Kingdom, "tawny" in Australia, and "ruddy" elsewhere. Sorrel (also called cinnamon or red), a lighter coppery base with chocolate brown ticking, is a unique mutation of this original pattern. Other variants have been introduced by outcrossing to the Burmese and other shorthaired breeds, notably blue (on a warm beige base) and fawn (on a softer creamy peach base). The less common chocolate and lilac are not recognized in the Cat Fancier's Association (CFA) breed standard but have been granted full champion status in The International Cat Association (TICA) and in the UK. The UK also recognizes the Silver Abyssinian, in which the base coat is a pure silvery white with black (called "usual silver"), blue, cream or sorrel ticking. Various other color combinations are in development, including the "torbie", in which a patched tortoiseshell pattern in any of these colors is visible under the tabby banding.

The breed owes their distinctive coat to a dominant mutant gene known as Ta. In 2007, the first cat to have its entire genome published was an Abyssinian named Cinnamon.

          <h3>Behaviour</h3>
          <img src="img/Abyssinian/Abykitten.jpg" alt="abbysinian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg" >

          <p>
            Veterinarian Joan O. Joshua has written that the "dog-like attachment to the owners" of Abyssinian and Burmese cats causes "greater dependence on human contacts". This stands in contrast to the mere "tolerant acceptance of human company" based around "comforts" that multiple other breeds display.

With their interest in playing with their owners combined with their curious intelligence, Abyssinians are sometimes called the "Clowns of the Cat Kingdom". They have soft chirrup-like vocalizations which do not sound like the expected "meow".

A study comparing Oriental, Siamese and Abyssinian kittens to Norwegian Forest cat kittens found that the former group was more likely to recede and hide as well as display other 'shy' behaviour.
          </p>
          <h3>Health</h3>
          <p>
            The breed can be prone to gingivitis, which can lead to more serious periodontitis. Familial renal amyloidosis or AA amyloidosis, a kidney disorder due to a mutation in the AA amyloid protein gene, has been seen in Abyssinians. The Abyssinian has had severe problems with blindness caused by a hereditary retinal degeneration due to mutations in the rdAc gene. However, the prevalence has been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008 in the country of Sweden. With the widespread availability of rdAc mutation detection tests and services, such as those provided by the UC Davis Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, it is possible to reduce the disease frequency in all populations of Abyssinian. An Australian analysis found the Abyssinian to be over-represented in cases of feline infectious peritonitis when compared to the expected frequency based on census data (4.4% versus 1.5%). In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Abyssinian was significantly under-represented, with only one of the recorded cases belonging to an Abyssinian.

The 2008 study "The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations" by Lipinski et al. conducted at UC Davis by the team led by leading feline geneticist Dr Leslie Lyons found that the Abyssinian has a low level of genetic diversity, a heterozygosity value of 0.45 within a range of 0.34-0.69 for all breeds studied, and has genetic markers common to both Southeast Asian and Western breeds indicating that cats from both Asia and Europe were used to create the breed.

            <strong>Aegean cats</strong> (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου gáta tou Aigaíou) are a naturally occurring landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western Turkey. It is considered a natural cat, developing without human interference. Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <img src="/img/Aegean/Aegean_Island_Cat.jpg" alt="Aegean_Island_Cat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
          <p>
            The Aegean cat, as its name suggests, originates from the Cycladic Islands in the Aegean Sea, where they occur as a natural landrace. Aegeans are considered one of the oldest domesticated cat breeds, cats having been introduced to the islands during the Bronze Age. They are common as feral cats in Greece and Turkey, where they are found amongst fishing ports asking for food offerings. In Greece, Aegean cats are considered a national treasure. Feral Aegean cats are notable predators of Aegean wall lizards in the Cyclades.
          </p>

          <h3>Aegean cats as pets</h3>
          <img src="/img/Aegean/Aegeancat7.jpg" alt="Aegean Cat" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg ">
          <p>
            Although the Aegean has only very recently begun to be bred systematically, it has been domesticated for many centuries and thus has become adapted very well to humans. It is a social pet that tolerates living in an apartment rather well. It is intelligent, active, lively and also communicative, not hesitating to draw a person's attention. 
          </p>

          <h3>Aegean cat characteristics</h3>
          
          <p>
            Aegean cats are a medium-sized, muscular, semi-longhaired cat. The coat is bicolour or tricolour with one of the colours being almost always white. White usually takes up between 1/4 to 9/10 of the body. The colour of their coat might include many other colours and patterns. Their paws are medium in size and have a round shape. Their tail can be long and "hooked". The ears have a wide base and rounded tips and are covered by hair. The eyes have an almond shape and their color can be any shade of green, blue and yellow.

Aegean cats are noted for their affinity for water and fishing. Because the breed was allowed to develop through natural selection, rather than selective breeding, Aegean cats are free from most feline genetic diseases.

              The <strong>American Bobtail</strong>is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s.It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat.The breed is not related to other short-tailed breeds, such as the Cymric cat, or the Japanese Bobtail or Kurilian Bobtail, despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different, as the mutation causing the American Bobtail's short tail is dominant; comparatively, the Japanese Bobtail, for example, has a tail mutation that is recessive.

              American Bobtails are a very sturdy breed, with both short- and long-haired coats. Their coat is shaggy rather than dense or fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat, with a strong emphasis on the "wild" tabby appearance in show animals.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Urban legend says that Bobtails are the result of a cross breeding between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and may be related to the Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.

This cat's original appearance genetics were modified in the breed to form a new and improved strain which comes in essentially all colors and coat types. The breed was first recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA, US-based), in 1989. The breed has been accepted for championship competition by TICA, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA, also US-based) and the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA). The breed is technically also sanctioned in the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all of ACFA's breed standards; it is unknown if any specimens are actually in China. The breed is "recognized" (as existing), as both American Bobtail Longhair and American Bobtail Shorthair, in the Germany-based World Cat Federation (WCF), but is not "accepted" for competition and has no WCF breed standard.</p>
  
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              American Bobtails require two to three years to develop, slower than many domestic cat breeds.

While the typically “bobcat-“ or “ocelot”-like spotted coat patterning is the most basal coloration seen on the breed, many other colors and patterns exist (both in long and shorthair varieties), including black, blue, brindle, brown, calico, chocolate, cinnamon, fawn, lilac, pied, red-and-cream, peach or orange tabby or tortoiseshell, all with or without varying amounts of all-white fur on the chest, neck, legs or underside.

The American Bobtail is hearty, short-tailed cat. Its body is moderately long, with substantial boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The torso is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost as wide as chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to body. There is a concave curve from nose to brow, or rise to prominent brow, a broad unpinched muzzle, prominent whisker pads, a gently sloped wide nose and full, strong jaws. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and the side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape, with size proportionate to head. The aperture is angled to base of ear, and with medium wide spacing and deep sockets. Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.
 </p>
  
            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            
            <p>
              American Bobtails are playful, social and some may be quite energetic, especially as kittens. They are considered to be highly adaptable to new environments, making them suitable companions for travelers. According to some sources, the American Bobtail is among the most “dog-like” of any cat breed, boldly greeting visitors to the home and never shying away from a potential opportunity to play, hunt or socialize. They have also been called miniature “ocelots”, at least in terms of their climbing abilities, and enjoy exploring, jumping, and stalking birds and small animals (even through windows). Overall, it is not a “sleepy” or reserved breed, though it still readily comes to humans and other cats and animals for affection, including dogs.

              The <strong>American Curl</strong>is a cat characterised by its unusual ears, which curl back from the face toward the center of the back of the skull. The breed originated in Lakewood, California, due to a spontaneous mutation.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The first American Curls appeared as strays on the doorstep of the Rugas in Lakewood, California in June 1981. The black female, named Shulamith, gave birth to a litter of cats with the same curled ears, and so became the ancestor of all American Curls today. In 1986, an American Curl was exhibited at a cat show for the first time, and in 1992, the longhaired American Curl was given championship status by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 1999, the American Curl became the first breed admitted to the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Championship Class with both longhair and shorthair divisions.
              The American Curl is a medium-sized cat 5-10 lb (2.3-4.5 kg), and does not reach maturity until 2-3 years of age. Females should be between 5-8 lb (2.3-3.6 kg) and males 7-10 lb (3.2-4.5 kg).

American Curl kittens are born with straight ears, which begin to curl within forty-eight hours. After four months, their ears will not curl any longer, and should be hard and stiff to the touch at the base of the ear with flexible tips. A pet-quality American Curl may have almost straight ears, but showcats must have ears that curl in an arc between 90 and 180 degrees. A 90 degrees is preferable, but cats will be disqualified if their ears touch the back of their skulls.

Both longhaired and shorthaired American Curls have soft, silky coats which lie flat against their bodies. They require little grooming and enjoy spending time with their owners and generally get along well with other animals and people who aren't their owners.

The American Curl, while still an uncommon breed, is found across the world in the United States, Spain, France, Japan, Russia, and many other countries.  

            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <img src="/img/Americal curl/ACL_Pointocurl_Fiorentina.jpg" alt="American curl" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Due to its large genetic pool with non-pedigree cats, the American Curl is generally a healthy breed. However, their ears should be handled carefully, as rough handling may damage the cartilage in the ear, and require frequent cleaning to prevent infections.

              Various matings between cats with curled ears and cats without curled ears revealed a dominant inheritance of the curl gene. Sex-linked distribution was not found. The mutant gene was designated as curl and is symbolized by Cu. Another mutation of the ear pinna was found in Scottish Fold cats. In these cats both heterozygous and homozygous (FdFd) cats, animals suffer from osteochondrodysplasia. The question arises if homozygous curls (CuCu) could also be affected by cartilage formation defects and bone abnormalities. However, observations of a CuCu cat over two years showed no sign of anomaly.

              The <strong>American Shorthair</strong> is a breed of domestic cat believed to be descended from European cats brought to North America by early settlers to protect valuable cargo from mice and rats. According to the Cat Fanciers' Association, it was the eighth most popular pedigreed cat in the world for 2020.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              When settlers sailed from Europe to North America, they carried cats on board (ships' cats) to protect the stores from mice—for instance, the cats that came over on the Mayflower with the Pilgrims to hunt rats on the ship and in the colony. Many of these cats landed in the New World, interbred, and developed special characteristics to help them cope with their new life and climate. Early in the 20th century, a selective breeding program was established to develop the best qualities of these cats.

The American Shorthair is a pedigree cat breed, with a strict conformation standard, as set by cat fanciers of the breed and the North American cat fancier associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA) and the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally known as the Domestic Shorthair, the breed was renamed in 1966 to the "American Shorthair" to better represent its "all-American" origins and to differentiate it from other shorthaired breeds. The name "American Shorthair" also reinforces the fact that the breed is a pedigreed breed distinct from the random-bred non-pedigreed domestic short-haired cats in North America, which may nevertheless resemble the ASH. Both the American Shorthair breed and the random-bred cats from which the breed is derived are sometimes called working cats because they were used for controlling rodent populations, on ships and farms. The American shorthair (then referred as Domestic shorthair) was among the first five breeds that were considered as registered cat breeds by CFA during 1906.
            </p>

            <p>
              The American Shorthair is a medium to large sized cat breed with males weighing between 11-15 lbs (5-7 kg) and females weighing between 6-12 lbs (2.75-5.5kg). The head is large, resembling an oblong with more length than width. The ears are medium sized and slightly rounded at the tips. The eyes are large and wide. The neck is medium in length and well-muscled. The legs are medium in length and muscular. Tail is of medium length.

            <p>
              The American Shorthair is recognized in more than eighty different colors and patterns ranging from the brown-patched tabby to the blue-eyed white, the silvers (tabbies, shaded, smokes and cameos) to the calico van, and many colors in between. Some even come in deep tones of black, brown, or other blends and combinations. Generally, only cats showing evidence of crossbreeding resulting in the colors chocolate, sable, lilac (lavender), or the point-restricted pattern of the Siamese family are disqualified from being shown.

              A study in Japan of cats suspected to have kidney problems found that 47% of tested American Shorthair cats had the PKD1 mutation, which is responsible for feline polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis in the United States found that the American Shorthair had significantly lower odds of developing urate uroliths than mixed-breed cats.</p>

              The <strong>American Wirehair</strong> is a breed of domestic cat originating in Staten Island New York, which is characterized by its wiry fur and crinkly whiskers caused by a genetic mutation. As of 2017, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The American Wirehair is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among a litter of five born to a pair of barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The dominant genetic mutation, which causes the wirehair, was found to be different from the Rex mutation of other curly-coated breeds—such as the Cornish Rex or Devon Rex. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, to a look at the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Council Rock Farms Adams of Hi-Fi ('Adam' for short) and the female Tip-Top.
              Breeding between the two produced wirehaired kittens, many of which were sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada and Germany, where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              American Wirehairs are similar to American Shorthairs, with the exception of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. When evaluating this breed, the emphasis is mostly on the quality of the coat - out of a total of 100 points for quality coat, an American Wirehair can get 45. This type of coat is easy to maintain because the gene determining the hardness of the coat is dominant. The Wirehair coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a Wirehair and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.            </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              The Wirehair has an even, balanced temperament which is essentially identical to that of its American Shorthair relative. Wirehairs are equally content to play or fall asleep in their owners' laps. They have been described as cute and somewhat humorous. They are gentle and quiet, but also playful and active. They have quiet voices. American Wirehairs generally prefer to stay indoors.             
            </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              All cats carry the potential for genetic health issues, just like humans are susceptible to hereditary diseases. Be cautious of any breeder who claims their breed is entirely free of health or genetic problems; such statements may indicate misinformation or deception. Steer clear of breeders who don't provide health guarantees for kittens or assert that their breed is 100 percent healthy. Additionally, avoid those who claim their kittens are exempt from common health concerns.

              While the American Wirehair is generally healthy, it can share some health issues with the American Shorthair due to potential crossbreeding, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most prevalent feline heart disease. HCM leads to the thickening of the heart muscle, and its presence can be confirmed through an echocardiogram. Be skeptical of breeders who assert having HCM-free lines, as no guarantee exists against its development.
              
              Responsible breeders screen American Wirehairs for HCM, and those identified with the condition should be excluded from breeding programs. Ensure that you purchase a kitten from parents tested for this disease and consider obtaining it from breeders with a written health guarantee.
              
              After welcoming a new kitten into your home, you play a pivotal role in safeguarding her health. Obesity is a common issue, and maintaining the American Wirehair at an appropriate weight is crucial for overall well-being. Leverage preventive measures to ensure a healthy and thriving cat throughout her life.

              <strong>Cyprus cats</strong>, also know as <strong>Cypriot cats</strong>, <strong>Saint Helen cats</strong> and <strong>Saint Nicholas cat</strong> are a landrace of domestic cat found across the island of Cyprus. A standardized breed is being developed from them; among cat fancier and breeder organizations, it is presently fully recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF), with breeding regulated by the World Cat Congress (WCC), under the name Aphrodite's Giant; and provisionally by The International Cat Association (TICA) as the Aphrodite. All three organizations permit shorthaired and semi-longhaired versions and no out-crossing to other breeds.

              The earliest known written record of cats on Cyprus refers to a story of Saint Helen of Constantinople sending two boatloads of cats to a monastery on the island from Egypt or Israel in the 4th century AD to deal with an infestation of snakes. Cats on Cyprus have been able to breed for centuries with comparatively little outside influence; this has resulted in a distinct, locally adapted variety of cat which appears to have developed as a feral population in the inner highlands, though is found throughout the island in modern times. While wildcats in association with humans on Cyprus date to at least 7500 BC - the earliest proven association of cats with humans - there is no known connection between those ancient tamed-wild specimens and modern domesticated Cyprus cats, despite breeder claims to the contrary.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              A paper by J.-D. Vigne, et al., concluded in 2004 that the discovery of Near Eastern wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) remains in a 9,500-year-old grave in Cyprus is the oldest example to date of a cat in close association with humans. Archaeologists led by Jean Guillain working at the Neolithic site of Shillourokambos uncovered carefully interred remains of a cat alongside human remains and decorative artifacts, on an island separated from the mainland since before human habitation, thus indicating human introduction of cats to the area. "Examination showed that a small pit or grave had been deliberately dug out, and the body of the cat was placed in it, then rapidly covered." The cat skeleton pre-dates Egyptian depictions of cats by 4,000 years or more. There is no evidence that modern cats of any variety are descended from ancient Cypriot wildcats; nevertheless both WCF and TICA have uncritically repeated breeder claims of such descent.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/Aphrodite Giant/Cyprus_Cat_Yawning.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              Cyprus cats of today are more likely linked with the monastery named Saint Nicholas of the Cats (Greek: Άγιος Νικόλαος των Γατών, romanized: Ágios Nikólaos ton Gatón), which was founded in the 4th century AD. It is located near Akrotiri. According to Byzantine legend, Helena of Constantinople (Saint Helen) shipped hundreds of cats from Egypt or Palestine to Cyprus in 328 AD to control venomous snakes that had infested the area around the monastery, following a drought lasting 37 years. The monastery had two bells, one to call the cats to meals and the other to send them into the fields to hunt snakes. The population of cats at the site (today a nunnery) once dwindled, but has now revived thanks to care by the resident nuns. The Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis wrote of these cats in his poem "The Cats of St. Nicholas". The story being a legend, it is impossible to know for certain today if shiploads of cats were really sent to Cyprus in the 4th century and cats have, of course, been arriving on the island (often as ship's cats) for many centuries.

            <img src="/img/Aphrodite Giant/Cyprus-Cat-Limassol-Castle.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The World Cat Congress is of the opinion that Cyprus cats developed over time in mountainous inner Cyprus from various populations of cats around the island and became large and bushy-haired to cope with hunting comparatively large prey like rats, big lizards and snakes in cool, wet, mountain weather, though summers there are fairly hot and dry (Both WCF and TICA note that the thickness of the coat in purebred Aphrodite cats descended from this populations still varies seasonally). The other two organizations' breed summaries are generally consistent with this view, though it is uncertain who first produced this account of their origin, or on what basis. It is unclear whether Cyprus cats are closely related to the broader Aegean cat landrace of mainland and island Greece. Genetic testing to date (see below) has shown only that the Cyprus cats are distinct enough that a breed could be developed from them.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              Cyprus cats are somewhat thick-haired (from short-haired up to "semi-longhaired" in cat fanciers' jargon), and are an athletic and energetic variety. Feral populations are found throughout the island of Cyprus, from mountainous and cooler regions to the lower, hotter areas near the coasts, including in the cities. As such, this cat has locally adapted to different climates / seasonal change; however, it may be more associated with the mountainous areas.            </p>

          
             <h3>Aphrodite breed development</h3>
             <img src="/img/Aphrodite Giant/Cyprus-Cat-Cape-Greco.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              Local breeders began in 2006 to attempt to establish a standardized breed from local feral cats. In 2008, a World Cat Federation (WCF) all-breeds judge visited Cyprus to work at a cat show and was introduced to a breeder of purebred cats developed in this trial breeding program from the Cyprus cats. Considering the cats distinct, he wrote a standard of points and named them Aphrodite Giant. The president and board members of WCF advised that these Aphrodite cats should be shown outside Cyprus to become better known within the cat fancy, but did not immediately accept the nascent breed. Subsequently, a group of interested people in Cyprus decided to form a club, which was named the Cyprus Cats National Breed Association (CyCNBA), which applied for government approval and started functioning in late 2009. CyCNBA applied to affiliate to the WCF in April 2012.

In addition, it was agreed that a letter be sent to a leading specialist in cat genetics, Leslie A. Lyons of University of California, Davis, asking whether she would agree to DNA-test a selection of Cyprus cats to see whether it was possible to genetically define them as a breed. The professor, who intended shortly to begin a further study of Turkish Van and Turkish Angora cats (whose ancestry has long been disputed), agreed to study samples submitted from Cyprus. A total of 248 cats were studied, including a number of random-bred Cyprus cats from the Malcolm Cat Sanctuary, for comparison. "All cats were considered in one large analysis. The analysis partitioned the cats based solely on genetic variation, not by any other identification." (L. Lyons - 2 January 2012) The January 2012 report concluded that "Cyprus cats are a distinct population within the Mediterranean" and that a "breed from Cyprus could be developed".

On 1 July 2012, the cat became a fully recognised breed of the WCF, originally as just the Aphrodite's Giant Longhair (though it is actually in the organization's semi-longhaired division,) after the CyCNBA attended the WCF General Assembly in Gelsenkirchen, Germany and applied for recognition of the cats in April 2012. Today, WCF also recognizes a short-haired variant.

In September 2017, The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the cats, under the name Aphrodite, as a "preliminary new breed", in its own breed group and with both shorthaired and semi-longhaired varieties. Some TICA members have started breeding programs for the Aphrodite in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

In breeder terminology, this constitutes a natural or traditional breed - one developed from local stock to preserve its key characteristics, rather than created by breeders to have new features.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed standards</h3>
            <img src="/img/Aphrodite Giant/CypursLongHairCatandShortHair.jpg" alt="Aphrodite Giant" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The WCF standard calls for the Aphrodite's Giant to be large, strong, and muscular but not cobby, and big-boned even as kittens. The cats may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and of any colors other than colorpoint or mink (which comes from the Burmese gene), nor with any white spots if otherwise solid-colored. "In bicolour, non-regular colour setting is desired." The coat should be soft and wooly, and is expected to be longer and with an undercoat in winter, and always lacking any top coat except possibly on the back. In detail, WCF calls for muscular hips and shoulders; back legs slightly longer than front (a trait shared with another insular breed, the Manx); medium-long, "well-plumed" tail, commensurate with body size (and visibly tapering in the shorthaired version); a long-triangular head with straight cheeks, long and straight muzzle, "strong" chin, rounded front of the face, slightly domed forehead and "a very slight dip under the height of the eyes"; wide-based, medium-large ears, forming an open V (rather than being straight upward); and olive-shaped, oblique-set eyes of any uniform color. Weight range is not specified.

WCF has set no temperament or breeding rules for this breed, and defers on breeding points instead to the World Cat Congress (WCC), which permits no out-crossing, other than between the longhaired and shorthaired varieties of the breed. Only WCC (a confederation of national and international cat federations, which does not itself issue breed standards, just breeding regulations) uses the term Aphrodite's Giant Shorthair for the latter. WCC asks that judges disqualify smaller specimens of both, to preserve the large-boned nature of the breed.
</p>
<p>
Under the TICA definition, Aphrodites may be shorthaired or semi-longhaired and have any color and pattern, except they may not be colorpoint or mink and should not have a "locket" spot on the chest. The coat should be soft and lush and may seasonally vary in undercoat density (not required). They are "athletic, well-muscled, solid" and of medium to large build, but must have a gentle, non-aggressive temperament. Fully adult male weight range is 15-18 pounds (6.8-8.2 kg); female, 10-14 pounds (4.5-6.4 kg), which is heavy for a female cat. On finer points, the TICA standard calls for hips and shoulders of the same width; back legs slightly longer than front; an overall long-triangular, straight-cheeked head with a squared but not flattened muzzle and slight concavity between nose and brow leading to a slightly rounded forehead; wide-based, wide-set and fairly large ears forming an open V; oblique, olive-shaped eyes of any color; a full-width chin of normal depth; medium-long, tapering tail consistent with the body and coat (and plumed in the longhaired version). Jowls are permitted in adult males. No out-crossing to other cats is permitted (though the two varieties of Aphrodite are a single breed for TICA purposes).
</p>
<p>
WCF and TICA sharply conflict with each other on the cat's speed of maturity, perhaps owing to different foundation stock for their breed variants. The WCF standard says that they develop quickly, while TICA says they are comparatively slow to mature (another trait shared with the Manx), taking three to five years to reach full size.

TICA's overview of the breed describes them as affectionate and social and in some ways dog-like in behavior toward their keepers.

              The <strong>Arabian Mau</strong> is a formal breed of domestic cat, originated from the early African wildcat, a short-haired landrace native to the Arabian Peninsula. It lives in the streets of the Arabian Peninsula and has adapted very well to its climate. The Arabian Mau is recognized as a formal breed by few fancier and breeder organization and cat registry, World Cat Federation (WCF) and Emirates Feline Federation (EFF). Based on one landrace, the Arabian Mau is a natural breed.

              It is medium in size, with a body structure that is rather large and firm, not particularly slender, and with well-developed musculature. The legs are comparatively long, with oval paws.
              </p>
              <p>
              The head appears round but is slightly longer than broad. The nose is slightly concave curved when viewed in profile. The whisker pads are clearly pronounced, with a slight pinch. The chin is very firm. The eyes are slightly oval, large and slightly slanted. The cat may have any normal cat eye color. There is no relation between the eye and coat colors. Usually, Arabian Maus have bright green eyes. The ears are large, slightly forward and sideward-placed, a little long, and high-set on the skull.
              
              While Arabian Maus are not technically hypoallergenic, its low propensity for shedding and dander production may cause lesser reactions in those with mild allergies.
            </p>

            <img src="/img/Arabian Mau/Arabian_Mau1.jpg" alt="Arabian Mau" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">
            <p>
              The breed has been a landrace native to the Arabian peninsula in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates for more than 1,000 years. Desert cats are well adapted to the hot environment of parts of Arabia
            </p>
            <h3>Grooming</h3>

            <p>
              Arabian Mau have short fur without an undercoat and as such, are not high shedders. They are very capable of keeping themselves neatly groomed. This makes grooming for the owner quite easy. While not always necessary, brushing will remove dead hairs and intensify the beautiful gloss of the coat.            
            </p>

          
             <h3>Standard Arabian Mau</h3>
             <img src="/img/Arabian Mau/Arabian_Mau_pose.jpg" alt="Arabian Mau" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              Females are medium-sized and elegant; however, males can be much larger and have muscular bodies. Their legs are long with perfectly oval paws. The tail has medium length with tapering toward the tip. The head appears to be round, but it is slightly longer than broad with well-defined whisker pads. Ears are large and well set. Their eyes are oval and match the coat color. The fur is short and has no undercoat, besides it lying close to the body. The coat should not be silky. The colors can be different but the most recognized are red, white, black, and brown tabby.

The Arabian Mau cat breed is a natural breed, so it must reflect the morphology and behavioral features of the cats living on the Arabian Peninsula. The standard has been drafted on the observation and the description of physical characteristics, which have been found in the cats of this area average population, originating from the Middle East and in its descendants. No prefixed model has been followed.

The Arabian Mau cats were approved by the WCF during the Annual General Meeting held on August 2-3, 2008 in Germany. The Arabian Mau cats have been able to participate in international shows since January 1, 2009.

              The <strong> Asian</strong> or <strong> Asian group</strong>is a cat breed similar to the European Burmese but in a range of different coat colours and patterns. Long-haired Asians of all varieties are called Tiffanies. Asians are grouped in section 5 (Burmese) by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was accidentally developed in the United Kingdom, starting with a litter of 4 kittens resulting from a mismating of a chinchilla Persian stud, Jamari Sanquist, and a lilac European Burmese queen, Bambino Lilac Faberge, bred in 1981 by Baroness Miranda von Kirchberg.
            </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              After the first litter of kittens were born in 1981, breeders believed the kittens showed potential to become their own breed. Early breeders decided the phenotype of the kittens was to be exactly the same as the Burmese, but in more colours and varieties. All varieties gained championship status with the GCCF in 2003, with the Tiffanie being the last variety to gain it
             </p>

            <h3>Asian group</h3>
            <p>
              In appearance, the Asian group is essentially identical to the Burmese breed, but they come in more colours and patterns, and in the case of the Tiffanies (Asian semi-longhairs), longer fur. Smoke is the term used for self/solid coloured silvers (uniform distribution), while shaded and tipped silvers are silver tabbies (distribution in tabby pattern) with 'wide banding'. The Asian group incorporates the:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>Asian Bombay</li>
              <li>Asian Shaded or Burmilla (silver or golden shaded and tipped)</li>
              <li>Asian Smoke (smoke),</li>
              <li>Asian Tabby (tabby),</li>
              <li>Tiffanie or Asian (semi-)longhair (longhair variety).</li>
             </ul>

             <h3>Asian Smoke</h3>
             <img src="/img/Asian/smoke.jpg" alt="Asian" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

             <p>
              The Asian Smoke is a non-agouti cat with a white undercoat that is not always noticeable. When the Asian was originally being developed Burmillas were bred with Burmese. These cats were given the name 'Burmoire' due to the moire-like effect of their coats — this look is now considered undesirable for the Asian Smoke.

                The solid black Bombay under the Asian Self-category has a slightly different origin, but is also developed in the UK. In the early 1980's, the resulting kittens of three mismatings of European Burmese with black domestic short-haired cats were developed into the British-type Bombay.[10]
                
                Additionally, there exist another variant of the Bombay cat, the American-type Bombay developed in the United States. American-type Bombays were developed by crossbreeding sable American Burmese and black American Shorthair cats, to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat and exclusively with bright copper-golden eyes. For the British-type Bombay golden eyes are preferred, but yellow through to green is acceptable, with the preference given to greater depth of colour.

              <p>
                The Asian Tabby is an Asian cat with tabby markings. However unlike regular tabbies the coat has a reduced melanin concentration which results in lighter tabby markings. Asian Tabbies come in all four traditional tabby markings and most tabby colourings.

             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              Ancestral breeds of the Asian have been known to carry Polycystic Kidney Disease and Progressive retinal atrophy, however, only Burmese Hypokalaemia has been identified in the Asian.

Many Asian breeders and their cats were involved in the research into the disease, and as of 2018 all registered breeders with the Asian Cat Association are required to test for hypokalaemia for all Asian group cats intended for use in breeding.

              The <strong>Tiffanie</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair[12] or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
             </p>
            <h3>Recognition</h3>
            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>American Mist</strong> (formerly known as Spotted Mist) is a breed of cat developed in Australia. It is a cross between the Abyssinian cat, the Burmese cat, and the Australian Tabby cat. The Australian Mist has a distinct and unique coat pattern hence the name.
             </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              This breed was developed in Australia in 1977 by Dr. Truda Straede with a gene-pool of approximately 30 foundation cats. Dr. Straede submitted a plan to the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW Cat Control (RASCC) for a breed with blue, brown, chocolate, and lilac colourings by using Burmese; and for a spotted tabby pattern by using the ticking gene of Abyssinian to go with a spotted tabby coat. The first generation of the breed was accepted into the RASCC experimental category in May of 1980 and in April of 1986 the fourth generation was accepted as the 'Spotted Mist'. In June of 1997 the marbled variety of the breed was accepted by the RASCC and Waratah State Cat Alliance. Due to the newly accepted marbled variety it was decided by the Co-ordinating Cat Council of Australia and the Australian Cat Fancy to rename the breed — in a unanimous decision the name 'Australian Mist' was chosen.
             </p>
            <h3>Breed recognition</h3>
            <p>
              On January the 1st 1999 the breed received champsion status with the New Zealand Cat Fancy. The breed was accepted for championship status by the World Cat Federation in August 2004. The first Australian Mists were imported into the United Kingdom in 2007. The breed was given prelimary recognition by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in October of 2011. It was accepted at championship status in TICA (The International Cat Association) on 1 May 2014. It gained championship status with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in February 2017. The breed is not yet recognized by the Fédération Internationale Féline.

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              The Australian Mist is a medium-sized short-haired cat, with a round and medium-sized head, a broad nose, and large green eyes. Eye colour can range from chartreuse to aquamarine. Ears are moderately large with a rounded tip to them. The coat is short to medium in length and feels smooth and silky.

   </p>

   <h3>Distributon</h3>

            <p>
              Due to the novel status of the breed outside Australia most Australian Mist catteries are located in Australia; however, there are a few in the UK and USA. Breeding cats have also been sent to Norway.
   </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              The following conditions are commonly screened for in breeding Australian Mist cats — Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency, Hypokalaemic Polymyopathy, Neonatal Isoerythrolysis, and Progressive Retinal Atrophy.

              The <strong>American Wirehair</strong> is a breed of domestic cat originating in Staten Island New York, which is characterized by its wiry fur and crinkly whiskers caused by a genetic mutation. As of 2017, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The American Wirehair is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among a litter of five born to a pair of barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The dominant genetic mutation, which causes the wirehair, was found to be different from the Rex mutation of other curly-coated breeds—such as the Cornish Rex or Devon Rex. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, to a look at the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Council Rock Farms Adams of Hi-Fi ('Adam' for short), and the female Tip-Top.
              Breeding between the two produced wirehaired kittens, many of which were sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada and Germany, where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.
            </p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              American Wirehairs are similar to American Shorthairs, with the exception of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. When evaluating this breed, the emphasis is mostly on the quality of the coat - out of a total of 100 points for quality coat, an American Wirehair can get 45. This type of coat is easy to maintain because the gene determining the hardness of the coat is dominant. The Wirehair coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a Wirehair and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.            </p>

            <h3>Behavior</h3>
            <p>
              The Wirehair has an even, balanced temperament which is essentially identical to that of its American Shorthair relative. Wirehairs are equally content to play or fall asleep in their owners' laps. They have been described as cute and somewhat humorous. They are gentle and quiet, but also playful and active. They have quiet voices. American Wirehairs generally prefer to stay indoors.             
            </p>
             <h3>Health</h3>
             <p>
              All cats carry the potential for genetic health issues, just like humans are susceptible to hereditary diseases. Be cautious of any breeder who claims their breed is entirely free of health or genetic problems; such statements may indicate misinformation or deception. Steer clear of breeders who don't provide health guarantees for kittens or assert that their breed is 100 percent healthy. Additionally, avoid those who claim their kittens are exempt from common health concerns.

              While the American Wirehair is generally healthy, it can share some health issues with the American Shorthair due to potential crossbreeding, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most prevalent feline heart disease. HCM leads to the thickening of the heart muscle, and its presence can be confirmed through an echocardiogram. Be skeptical of breeders who assert having HCM-free lines, as no guarantee exists against its development.
              
              Responsible breeders screen American Wirehairs for HCM, and those identified with the condition should be excluded from breeding programs. Ensure that you purchase a kitten from parents tested for this disease and consider obtaining it from breeders with a written health guarantee.
              
              After welcoming a new kitten into your home, you play a pivotal role in safeguarding her health. Obesity is a common issue, and maintaining the American Wirehair at an appropriate weight is crucial for overall well-being. Leverage preventive measures to ensure a healthy and thriving cat throughout her life.

              The <strong>Bambino</strong>  is a breed of cat that was created as a cross between the Sphynx and the Munchkin breeds. The Bambino cat has short legs and is hairless.

              
            </p>
            <img src="/img/Bambino/bambino-cat-free-puic-Google-Search.png" alt="Bambino" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              In 2005, The International Cat Association (TICA) records Bambinos as an experimental breed For tracking purposes, TICA will record any cat breeding under the category “experimental registry”. This is separate from the approved breeds that have met the health and genetics requirements to be shown. Bambinos are unable to be shown as a breed in TICA.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are recognised by the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry (REFR). However, most major cat registries do not recognise the Bambino cat breed. Several countries prohibited the breeding of Bambinos by law, due to their genetic health concerns.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The first litter of Bambino kittens was registered in 2005 by The International Cat Association (TICA) as an experimental breed.

              Bambino in Italian translates to "baby", referring to the cat's appearance of making it look like a kitten. The Bambino has short legs it inherits from the Munchkin, and huge upright ears, as well as having the hairlessness of the Sphynx.    
             </p>
            <h3>Breed concerns</h3>

            <p>
              Due to the concern of animal welfare, the breeding of Bambino cats is not legal in all countries. Some examples of Bambino breeding restrictions are Germany and the Federal German Animal Protection Act of 1999, and in the Netherlands it is forbidden since 2014 to breed with parent animals which have a genetic disease, such as the Bambino cat.[5][6][7] This law falls under the control of the Dutch inspection authorities of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).[8][9]

              Apart from TICA, most of the major cat registries do not allow the registry of the Bambino breed, nor recognise it due to concerns about their welfare. Among others, the breed is not recognised by:            
            </p>

            <h3>Physical characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The wrinkled hairless appearance and short legs are the breed's two most distinctive features. Though Bambinos can be coated with fur,[14] this, however, is referred to as a "coated Bambino".

              The back legs can be slightly longer than the front legs. The body is medium to long, with a broad chest and a well-rounded abdomen. Boning is medium. The whippy tail is in good proportion to the rest of the body. Some Bambinos can have a "lion tail"—a puff of hair on the tail tip. The head is a modified wedge with rounded lines, slightly longer than wide. As well as in the Sphynx, the cheekbones and whisker pads are very prominent. The whiskers are sparse and short. The chin is firm. The eyes are large, rounded, and wide spaced. The large ears are set upright, neither too low nor too high. The cat's size and physical qualities do not hamper its movements.           
             </p>
             <p>
              Their weight is typically 5 to 9 pounds (2.3 to 4.1 kg).
             </p>

             <h3>
              Coat and grooming
             </h3>
             <p>
              Even though some Bambinos appear hairless, they typically are covered with a fine downy fur. Their wrinkled skin feels like chamois or suede to the touch. Regular grooming is necessary to remove sebaceous secretions from the skin, and baths are recommended.[15][1] If grooming and bathing aren't done on a regular basis, the Bambino can become excessively dirty, oily, and sticky to the touch and/or develop skin conditions.[15]

The Bambino skin is vulnerable to temperature and sun, and they must be kept as an indoor cat. Contrary to popular belief, Bambino cats are not hypoallergenic.
             </p>

             <h3>Genetics and health</h3>
             <p>
              Bambino is called a mutation breed because it is a breed that requires both recessive mutations for the hairless gene, and dominant mutations for the dwarfed limbs.[16] Mutation breeding can be disastrous to the health of the produced kitten, if not done by an experienced breeder.

Typically Bambino litters produce both kittens that resemble and do not resemble the parents, and which can result in litters of short-legged and long-legged kittens, as the Bambino genetics are heterozygous for the short leg gene. Bambino litters cannot produce furry kittens as the hairless gene is recessive, and so each bambino has two copies of the hairless gene.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the breed is new, more research needs to be done to confirm the presence or absence of possible genetic health issues. However, common health problems typical of the related Munchkin breed of cat are well-known, the most common being an above higher average of lordosis (excessive curvature of the spine) and pectus excavatum (hollowed chest).

The Bambino breed is prone to developing bacterial skin conditions and infections due to the hairlessness and skin folds, as well as an inability to regulate the oiliness of their skin.

            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.

              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association.

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.

              The <strong>Birman</strong> also called the "Sacred Cat of Burma", is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white "gloves" on each paw.

            <p>
              The breed name is derived from Birmanie, the French form of Burma. The Birman breed was first recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1967. It is also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and the International Cat Association (TICA) in 1979.</p>
            </p>
            
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              No clear record of the breed's origin exists. They are most often claimed to have originated as the companions of temple priests in northern Burma in the Mount of Lugh. Many stories exist of how the cats first came to France, including pairs of cats being given as a reward for helping defend a temple, or being smuggled out of Burma and Sweden by a Vanderbilt. Another pair of Birmans (or a pregnant female called Poupée de Maldapour) were said to have been stolen and later imported to France by Thadde Haddisch. The first traces of historical Birmans go back to a Mme Leotardi in Nice, France.           
              </p>
              <p>
                Many believe, as legend will tell, that the breed originated in Burma (now known as Myanmar) among the temples of ancient times and alongside priests; however, there are also some that later believed the felines came to Europe, namely France, from somewhere in Asia, which has been spread from other legends and stories passed around as well. Regardless of the numerous stories and folklore that go around, there is a positivity that the Birman cat breed was found in France as early as the 1920s, and many different stories continue to surface about the mystique that lies behind their history.
              </p>
<p>
  Birmans were almost wiped out as a breed during World War II. Only two cats were alive in Europe at the end of the war, a pair named Orloff and Xenia de Kaabaa, both belonging to Baudoin-Crevoisier. The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966.
</p>
            <p>
              The first Birman cats were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using blue Persian lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points. Birmans have also been used in the development of new breeds such as the Ragdoll.
            </p>

            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="/img/Birman/Pépita_Sacré_de_Birmanie.jpg" alt="Birman" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              Birmans have a medium-sized, rectangular body with a broad face and distinct Roman nose. Their ears are ideally as wide on the base as they are tall and should be set as much on top of the head as on the side. The eyes are rounded and should be a deep sapphire blue.

              The Birman's fur is medium-long and should have a silky texture. Unlike a Persian or Himalayan, they have no undercoat, thus are much less prone to matting. Coat colour is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white, symmetrical "gloves" on each paw that are the trademark of the breed. The white must involve all toes and in front must stop at the articulation or at the transition of toes to metacarpals. These gloves should extend noticeably further up the back of the leg (referred to as the "laces"), finishing with an inverted V extended half to three-fourths up the hock. Any other spot of white on the points is considered a serious fault. The base body colour is white to cream, with a wash of colour that corresponds to the points, but is much paler.
              
              Recognized point colours are seal, chocolate, red and the corresponding dilute varieties: blue, lilac and cream. Tabby and tortie variations in seal, chocolate, blue or lilac are also allowed; other colours are in development.           
             </p>
             <p>
              Like all colour-point breeds, Birman kittens are born white and begin developing their points after one week if a dark colour (i.e. seal point) and 14 days or more if the points are "clear" or lighter-coloured (i.e. lilac point). Their coats do not reach full development up until the cats are two years old.
             </p>

            <h3>Genetic diversity</h3>
            <p>
              The 2008 study "The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations" by Lipinski et al. found that the Birman has one of the lowest levels of genetic diversity of all the breeds studied.            
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3> 
            <p>
              The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats. In Birman cats, it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolisation originating in the heart, and sudden death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paltrinieri, Giraldi, Prolo, Scarpa, et al. (2017) found that Birman cats have a high serum concentration of creatinine and symmetric dimethylarginine, but most Birman cats have higher concentrations of creatinine than SDMA. Creatinine is a creatine phosphate and is produced during metabolism of creatine, and is excreted through urination. SDMA is a methylated form of the amino acid arginine and is released during normal catabolisms of body proteins. Levels of creatinine and SDMA are found when Birman cats are tested for chronic kidney disease, for which they are at high risk. Birman cats are also at risk of developing feline infectious peritonitis; a disease that alters the renal function (creatinine levels in blood and urine) in the cats.[15] In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Birman was over-represented with an odds ratio of 6.77.
            </p>
            <h3>Birman naming convection</h3>
            <p>
              Many Birman breeders follow the French tradition of assigning all kittens born in a particular year given names that begin with the same letter of the alphabet. Countries with breeders using this convention include Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. Kittens born in 2016 would start with 'N', and in 2017 'O', and so on.

              The <strong>Bombay</strong> is a short-haired breed of domestic cat. Bombays are glossy solid black cats with a muscular build, and have characteristic large bright copper-golden eyes. The breed is named after the Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai), referring to the habitat of the Indian black leopard.
            </p>
            <p>
              There exist two different variants of Bombay breed; the American Bombay and the British Bombay, which are both referred to as just Bombay. American-type Bombays were developed by crossbreeding sable American Burmese and black American Shorthair cats,[1][5] to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat with copper-golden eyes. British-type Bombays are solid black-coloured Asian Self cats under the Asian group, a group of European Burmese and chinchilla Persian crosses. The British-type Bombay originated from three mismatings of European Burmese with black domestic short-haired cats.            
            </p>

              This article covers the American-type Bombay, see Asian cat for the British-type Bombay.

            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The breed was developed by Nikki Horner, a breeder from Louisville, Kentucky, who, starting in 1958, attempted to create a breed of cat that resembled a miniature black panther. The first attempt was a failure, but the second, in 1965, was successful. The breed was officially recognised and registered by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1970 and The International Cat Association in 1979
                         </p>
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <img src="/img/Bombay/Njunjo2.jpg" alt="Bombay" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              The Bombay is described as the “patent leather kid with the new penny eyes.” The Bombay is a short-haired breed of domestic cat, closely related to the Burmese. Bombay cats are characterised as having an all-black coat, including the whiskers, and black skin, including the soles, nose leather and mouth. The close-lying, sleek and glossy black coat is of mature cats is coloured to the roots with no paling (exceptions are allowed in juvenile cats less than 2 years old). The eyes are always copper-golden coloured, and green eyes are not allowed.   
                     </p>
            <p>
              The Bombay has a medium-sized, Oriental-type body build that is muscular. Their weight ranges between 2.5-5 kg (5.5-11.0 lb), with males typically being heavier than females.
            </p>

            <h3>Breed standard</h3>
            <img src="/img/Bombay/Njunjo3.jpg" alt="Bombay" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              <strong>Body </strong>: Medium size, graceful and elongated Oriental-type body. Elegant tail of medium length.            
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Head</strong> : Rounded heads with no sharp angles, and short. The shape is smooth. The muzzle is short, with a moderate nose “stop” which is visible (not a break). The medium-sized ears are wide-set, straight, and rounded at the tips. The large, round eyes are set far apart and are always copper-coloured, but can range from bright orange to warm golden. Green eyes are not allowed.
            </p> 
            <p>
              <strong>Coat</strong>: Short, dense and shiny, tight to the body, with a lacquered sheen. Only completely solid black coloured coats are allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Weight</strong>: For females, the average is 6 to 8 pounds. For males, the average is 8 to 10 pounds.


            </p>
            <h3>
              Health
            </h3>
            <p>
              A healthy Bombay has an average lifespan of 15 years, and some have been known to live up to 20. They can have some nasal and sinus problems, and gingivitis. Their food intake should be controlled to avoid overfeeding.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Temperament
            </h3>
              <p>
                The personality of the Bombay tends to be highly social, is marked by strong attachment to families, and is typified by craving attention. As a breed, they are therefore highly suitable for children.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bombay cats are happy and comfortable being strictly indoor cats, and can comfortably live in a single room apartment, so long as all of their needs are met. They prefer quiet surroundings.

              The <strong>Tiffanie</strong> is a cat breed similar to the Asian Shorthair except it has semi-long fur length. The breed belongs to the Asian Group and is generally recognised in any of the Asian Shorthair or Burmese colours and patterns. Like the other cats in the Asian Group, the breed was developed during the 1980s in the United Kingdom by crossbreeding a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cat registries that recognise the breed, it is officially registered under the name Tiffanie or within the Asian Group as Tiffanie or Asian Longhair. In some registries the colouration is restricted to silver or golden tipped or shaded, and the breed is registered as Burmilla Longhair[12] or Australian Tiffanie. Among the cat fancy the breed is also known as the Asian Semi-longhair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie is often confused with the now extinct and unrelated Chantilly-Tiffany, or Foreign Longhair, a longhaired North American breed originating from chocolate-brown cats of unknown origin. Similarly, the Tiffany in the NZCF (New Zealand) refers to a Burmese longhair.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The Tiffanie was developed in the 1980s in the United Kingdom as a longhaired version of the Asian Shorthair. The breed origins can be traced back to matings between a Persian Chinchilla and a Burmese.

            <img src="/img/Tiffanie/IMGP3621_(52342024792).jpg" alt="Tiffanie" class="float-end img-thumbnail catImg">

            <p>
              It has full recognition in the GCCF,LCWW, LOOF, SACC, preliminary status with the WCF, and has registration only status with The International Cat Association. The Australian Tiffanie is recognised by ANCATS and the Burmilla longhair by ACF, which are distinctly different in colour to the Asian Semi-longhair Tiffanie as these only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded
            </p>

            <h3>Australian Tiffanie</h3>
            <p>
              One governing body in Australia (Waratah National Cat Alliance, WNCA, now the Australian National Cats Inc., ANCATS) uses the name Australian Tiffanie; however, international acceptance and standardisation did not follow. It is different from the European Tiffanie and the North-American Chantilly-Tiffany. The Tiffanie from the UK is also originating from crossbreeding chinchilla Persian and Burmese cats. However, Australian Tiffanies are essentially longhair Burmillas, as they only come in silver or golden tipped or shaded. The breed is separately developed in the late-1990s in Australia from European Tiffanie cats by breeding them back to the chinchilla Persian. Therefore, many Australian Tiffanies contain more than three-quarters chinchilla Persian and retain the appearance and temperament of the Old-Fashioned chinchilla Persian. To summarise, the Australian Tiffanie and Tiffanie from the UK are both developed from crossbreeding chinchilla Persians and Burmeses, but the Australian version contains more chinchilla Persian. Consequently, only silver and golden tipped and shaded is allowed in the Australian Tiffanie. The name's use is declining in favour, due to the lax standards for the breed name, the lack of unique identity and the varied genetic makeup.
